        "reviewText": "But its a pretty good film. A bit of a mess in some parts, lacking the cohesive and effortless feel infinity war somehow managed to accomplish. Some silly plot holes and characters that could've been cut (Ahem, captain marvel and thanos). The use of Captain marvel in this film was just ridiculous. Shes there at the start, bails for some reason? And then pops up at the end to serve no purpose but deux ex machina a space ship...\n\nThe past thanos part wasn't necessary when you think about it, they could've done this film without a real 'villain' And it would've worked and been a original take on a super hero film without using the same formula we have seen in 10+ super hero films already. The entire final battle felt like a rehashed messy battle, with a bunch more characters against thanos - basically mixing the space battle from infinity war; iron man, spider man etc and the final battle of infinity war with captain america, thor etc.. mashing those two into one within this new film. The scenes of trying to pull the gauntlet off his hand.. it all felt like a rehash.\n\nTo me the best part of the film was the first act and half of the second, when everyone is lost and trying to figure out how to continue on. really interesting themes that followed the pay off from infinity wars ending. And then the time heist part. Tho the heist part should've been much more stretched out. With only small parts of thanos within that, and not having him be the big bad again. But just a side character that gets in the way a little bit.\n\nAnd the setting up for 'new avengers' to replace the beloved actors and characters we have come to associate with these films.. they do not get me at all excited for the next phase in marvel films. Falcon, Valkyrie, blackpanther, cap marvel? I just dont care about them at all. And their actors lack any charisma or depth.\n\nTo me this feels like a closing of marvel films that I'll really enjoy for my pop corn fix. I've given infinity war a 10/10 and some of the stand alone films 8's and 9's. But I have a sinking feeling this will not be happening in the future except the guardians of the galaxy films.\n\nIt seems i maybe in the minority for my feelings towards this film, but im not sugar coating my opinion like it seems a few people are doing due to nostalgia. Its good, but not great. Had the opportunity to be better, maybe? And the setting up of new characters to come possible reflects on my score to... Because i just don't give two cents about any of them",

        "reviewText": "After Avengers Infinity War, we waited for the Avengers Endgame. We wondered how the story would go on, how our heroes would turn back, what would be the end of Thanos. Many theories related to this have been put forward. Avengers Endgame was undoubtedly the most anticipated film of recent years. Normally, the higher the expectation, the higher the probability of disappointment. But this is not the case for Endgame. Whatever you're expecting, you find much more in the film. This means that the biggest concern about the film has disappeared.\n\nOn the other hand, another comparison comes up. Is Endgame more successful than Infinity War? We can comfortably say it Avengers Infinity War is just the beginning of the story. Endgame was the finale of the story. So we shouldn't think of these two films as two separate stories. There is only one story divided into two parts.\n\nAvengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team. Everyone's concern was that Captain Marvel, who was included in the Marvel world, overshadowed other heroes. We can say that this certainly did not happen. What is important in this struggle is not how strong you are, but how good you are. This comes to the fore in all areas. It gives good message about being a hero and a family.\n\nOf course, Avengers Endgame has some critical aspects. For example, is the three-hour period necessary in terms of the story? It can be discussed. The head of the story moves much slower than the rest. It also drags the heroes into an emotional predicament. Then the tempo is rising and the heavy scenes we are watching are getting more meaningful. The last 45 minutes of the movie is fully action packed. But the last 45 minutes goes so fast that you don't even realize it. Action and battle scenes are really successful. There is not even a slight distress about visual effects. There are also slight logic errors in the film, but in general the story is so successful that these details become meaningless and insignificant after a certain point.\n\nLastly, Avengers Endgame doesn't have a movie end scene. Because after the film's final, there is no need for another scene. The Marvel legend Stan Lee appears with a small stage. But this is the last surprise scene in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Moreover, there is no clue about Marvel's future. This makes us wonder more about Spider-Man: Far from Home. 10/10",

        "reviewText": "I've just come from watching Endgame and I must say that I am disappointed.\n\nI loved Civil War and I loved Infinity War. When I came out of those films, I knew immediately that they were great and that I wanted to see them again. With Endgame, I'm not sure.\n\nI respect how they were prepared to show the consequences of what Thanos had done but by killing him off so quickly and then them having to do their own stone quest (hadn't we already seen Thanos doing this in IW) it felt slow and lazy. Worse still was that it felt very self-indulgent and attempting to be clever for clever sake.\n\nLike how Back to the Future II considered itself clever for showing the events of the first film but with Marty flitting around behind the scenes to ensure that it all still happened. I know it's meant to be fan pleasing but it really felt like a gimmick and lacking in confidence. Almost like it was saying 'Hey guys, this will make you smile'. If you want to make me smile, concentrate on maintaining the quality of your product rather than directly trying to make me like you.\n\nBut the trouble with messing around with timelines and bouncing around is that it makes the audience start asking questions during the film. The linearity that we'd seen in IW and the imminent fast approaching threat is replaced in Endgame with a lack of direction and characters that are earlier versions of who the audience have seen.\n\nIn IW we were shown Thanos. He was written to be sympathetic or at least a character that we the audience could understand. He believed in what he was doing and this made him more rounded. But in Endgame, that version is dispatched quickly and we are supplied with a 2014 (?) Thanos who isn't the character we know but is just a token bad guy.\n\nThis Thanos hasn't made the sacrifice at Vormire, he isn't the guy that would empathise with Scarlet Witch for what she did to Vision. He has suddenly become a token cut out evil bad guy that needs to be defeated. Hell, the writers even manage to forget their own time loop by saying that this Thanos has learnt that he doesn't want to wipe out 50% anymore because they are too ungrateful. How does he know this when the 2014 Thanos has only just literally arrived in the post wipeout Universe? How has he had time to form the opinion that his previous quest for a 50% cull isn't worthy?\n\nIs this a case of the writers being terrified that they had created a bad guy that people related to or was it a fear that they'd written themselves into a hole? Why go to the effort of creating that character in IW to suddenly kill him off at the beginning of Endgame just for a dramatic punch?\n\nFor me, the time travelling and stone gathering wasted time to create unimportant scenes that fundamentally undermine the films that came before. In my opinion it would have been better if they had shown the remaining Avengers preparing to do some Avenging and maintained the single minded linearity of IW of battling towards and reaching a post click Thanos and somehow reversing his work.\n\nThe more I think of the film, the more plot holes and frustrations manifest themselves. Thor's drinking and man child antics might have been initially funny but one begins to realise that they are deliberately doing this to clip his wings. Likewise with Hulk, his primordial desire to smash and destroy has been removed to think it out and he has become an embarrassing shadow of his former self.\n\nThe thing that is meant to be amazing about the MCU is the world building but inconsistencies have been appearing and there are so many in Endgame that it makes you question whether these two films are written by the same people.\n\nIn IW, Thanos is a dangerous and credible threat because he has the infinity stones. He takes on half of the Avengers, Strange and some of the Guardians on Titan and smashes them and then takes on the other half on Wakanda and smashes them. Yet it is Stormbreaker (whose creation we have seen been hard earned by a motivated Thor) that has the power to take down Thanos even when he has a full complement of Infinity Stones.\n\nYet we roll forward to Endgame and we have literally all the good guys together in one place, Cap with his shield, Tony fully powered up, Scarlet Witch p*ssed and vengeful, Capt Marvel who can seemingly do anything and Thor wielding both Mjolnir AND Stormbreaker and Thanos NOT in possession of the gauntlet, yet they can't defeat him.\n\nIt's like the fights in IW were so amazing because the good guys were taking on an unbeatable foe yet here he is now seemingly defeatable by the 'rules' that the writers established . A good example of this would be in IW when Cap is the last man standing before Scarlet Witch and he grabs the gauntlet. You see the look of admiration/respect on Thanos' face that Cap is holding open the gauntlet before he punches him to the ground yet now that scene seems pointless.\n\nThe writers for Endgame seem to have been driven to undo everything they did in IW. All the tension, all the sacrifice, all the development of Thanos discarded for well, I don't know what. It makes no sense.\n\nIW had two incredible scenes that used to choke me up. When Cap appears in the train station, the Avengers theme kicks in and Falcon and Widow take down the henchman in a wonderfully choreographed scene. In just that one scene it shows them coming to the rescue, it shows how intuitively they work together and it showcases their heroism.\n\nLikewise when Thor creates Stormbreaker and makes his entrance on Wakanda, I felt it for the journey that Thor has been on. He's had to contend with loss and defeat and humiliation and this is his redemption. Here is a character that has earned his game changing weapon and when he arrives and demands to face a character that everyone else is running away from, I want to punch the air.\n\nBut in Endgame, that feels like it has to be corrupted. We can't have Thor being dominant, let's break him and make him a fool. We can't have Thanos being complicated and relatable, let's make him a cut out bad guy. We can't have Hulk being rage fuelled and smashing stuff up, let's make him more sensitive and talking stuff out. We can't have Cap being stoic and heroic, let's have him ridiculing one of his own iconic lines in a silly gimmicky fight with himself and commenting on his butt. We can't have a powerful female character that we're invested in look sexy AND be able to take down Thanos, let's give Scarlet Witch a small part but focus our attention on a female character that hasn't earnt our admiration or desire for revenge.\n\nTo be honest, the 'rules of engagement' had been set so well in IW that when in Endgame Thanos massed his ranks against the Avengers and then ALL of the good guys showed up, I was almost expecting the camera to pull away and not show the fight given that it was so obviously going to be an easy win for the good guys.\n\nAnd as for the big fight scene, it did reek of what DC always manage to do which is just throw everything into an end battle and bludgeon you with CGI and pyrotechnics so that you aren't really sure what is going on.\n\nIn the many fights in IW, you knew what was going on, you recognised the combatants, you understood the stakes and you identified the geography of the scene. In Endgame we got one big massive fight where everything was thrown in the pot and it was just assumed by the directors that we would be happy with all the flashing lights. And I have to say that considering that Steve and Tony fell out so hard, and that Tony's criticism of Steve was so unfair, that I really had hoped for more than just a handshake, a muttering of 'no worries' and 'here's your shield'. These guys wrote and directed Civil War, they created the line 'we fell out hard' and hence I had hoped for something deeper and more touching than a handshake.\n\nSteve wrote Tony a letter telling him that when he needed him he'd be there but once again the Iron Man bias had to creep in and once again Tony was the victim and the ultimate hero.\n\nBut I think my biggest problem is how the convenient time travelling undermines everything. When a franchise starts retrofitting stuff (like Fury's eye being from a space cat), it's then hard to consider the previous stories.\n\nHaving 2014 Gamorra means that all the evolution that we saw her go through in GOTG 1 and 2 is wasted. Having Cap marry Peggy means the pain of his sacrifice, him seeing her in Winter Soldier when she is suffering from Alzheimer's, hell even his blossoming relationship with Sharon Carter is kinda irrelevant. Having seen Thor at last step away from his two weaker origin films into the entertainment of Ragnarok and the redemption in IW leaves us now with a bumbling buffoon.\n\nWe know that what makes Captain America what he is, is the serum that makes him a super soldier. That he was transformed from a weakling to a superhuman. Sam Wilson is not a super soldier and he didn't take the serum. He is Falcon. Now maybe in the comics he becomes Cap but Bucky is a super soldier. Is the new Cap going to foil an evil plot and be defeated with a tazer or a knife to the chest? Consider the beatings that Steve has taken and the physical strength that he has shown we can recognise that Sam Wilson does not have that.\n\nI'm sorry to say but the Russo's have dropped the ball. Themselves and their writers have succumbed to their success and their desire to be engineers of political correctness and social change. I thought Endgame would be the high soaring end to this 10 year run of impressive movie entertainment but in the end the writers got carried away, the directors over reached and the studio sacrificed the integrity of their product for a chance to 'educate' us all. A real shame and a wasted opportunity.\n\nInfinity War is clearly the highlight of the last 10 years but even now I fear that repeated viewings will render it pointless considering how the makers decided to fundamentally damage it.",

It's riddled with far too many plot holes, cringy humor and weird character choices for me to give it anything over a 5. Hulk and Thor are completely butchered here as characters imo. The 2nd act is boring and does every time travel clich√© you could think of, third act however, although blatant fan service is fun and exciting to watch. 3rd act basically saves the movie. The main reason I saw this was to see how Captain America's arc ends since he is one of the few characters I care about in the mcu. Unfortunately Iron Man's arc is done way better here compared to Cap's. No spoilers but Captain America's ending is shoehorned in at the last second and makes no sense. It felt completely unnatural . Oh yeah and hulk dabs, in the year 2023.",

Probably not - until the DVD comes out.\n\nI've seen infinity war at least 5 times, and it's one of my favorite films.\n\nThat being said, i will compare the two movies for sure, and I just disliked the pacing, it was all over the place. Some Characters felt off, and some got little to no screen time, where others had too much.\n\nIt's just too many characters for one movie, even though infinity war did it much better, with just as many characters. I just can't put my finger on it.\n\nThe fighting scenes were alright, the first half lacked action, but the second half delivered some good solid scenes, nothing groundbreaking, but fun to watch. They can't reinvent the wheel, neither do they want to. They stick to what works, and that's alright.\n\nAll in all, the movie was a close 8/10, the fanboys who give it a 10 are just blind to accept the mistakes the movie made. It's not a perfect film, even an 8 is really generous in my opinion. The Movie works with nostalgia and gives fans of the MCU the things they wanted, more or less.\n\nStill thinking Thor 3 was the best MCU movie. Sue me.",

        "reviewText": "Only a month or so back I was talking to a friend about how much I hate it when serious movies use time travel to get their characters out of problems. I have no problem with movies like 'Back to the Future' or 'Hot Tub Time Machine' that are both comedy based and use the time machine as a plot for the movie as opposed to a solution for characters problems. When a serious movie uses it though it as lazy as writing as dream sequence in my opinion.\n\nAt the end of the day though that just underlines the problem with these movies. The heroes are far too powerful. Whatever power they need they simply possess conveniently. Heck, 'Dr Strange' can even see into the future to know exactly what to do to make sure everything turns out alright. If that isn't the stupidest thing I've ever seen in a movie I don't know what is.\n\nI felt like the movie went very much as expected as well. Sure some characters die, however they were pretty much telegraphed to do so long before the movie came out. There also seemed to be a lack of conflict as key moments. A lot of things went far too smoothly for my liking in terms of the plan. Finally, the ending with 'Iron Man' simply pulling the glove off 'Thanos' - what the hell was that? Was that supposed to be clever writing? 'Thanos' just standing there for an eternity doing nothing waiting for someone to stop him?\n\nA lot of the jokes failed to land too. This was a surprisingly unfunny movie. In a 3 hour movie I got maybe 3 light chuckles out of the film. Every joke just felt so forced and some of the characters who don't have a comedy background delivered them very poorly. 'Avengers: Endgame' is three hours of my life I would like back.",

      "text": "In the opening, Clint Barton is teaching his daughter archery on his secluded farm while his wife prepares a picnic lunch for them. Suddenly, Clint's daughter vanishes and the rest of Clint's family disintegrates, along with half of all life across the universe, the result of Thanos' snapping his fingers after acquiring all six Infinity Stones. Nebula and Tony Stark are stranded in space following their defeat by Thanos on Titan, but are returned to Earth by Carol Danvers and reunited with Natasha Romanoff, Bruce Banner, Steve Rogers, Rocket, Thor, and James Rhodes. The team formulates a plan to steal the Infinity Stones back from Thanos and use them to reverse his actions, but learn upon finding him that he had used the stones a second time to destroy them, preventing their further use. He tells the remaining Avengers that he did so to avoid using the Stones for further nefarious purposes. Enraged, Thor beheads Thanos, saying it's what he should have done in Wakanda.\n\nFive years later, Scott Lang escapes from the quantum realm to discover that his daughter Cassie is now a teenager and that Hope van Dyne, along with half of the population, has disappeared in the snap. Rogers has been leading grief counseling sessions for survivors still struggling with the effects of the snap, while Romanoff is tirelessly keeping watch over both Earth and the rest of the universe with the help of Rhodes, Danvers, Okoye, Rocket, and Nebula. Lang goes to Romanoff and Rogers, and explains that while five years had passed for them, only five hours had passed for him in the quantum realm and that time stretches much differently there.\n\nThe three go to Stark, who is now raising a child with Pepper Potts, and explain their theory that the quantum realm can be used to go back in time and steal the Infinity Stones before Thanos is able to collect them. Stark initially rejects their proposal with concern about risking his family and the peace he has found, but after reflecting upon the loss of Peter Parker decides to test theoretical models that would work with Lang's quantum tunnel, eventually finding one that works.\n\nWith Stark now on board the remaining Avengers set out to reassemble their team. Bruce Banner has now embraced the Hulk as a part of him, and has melded his own consciousness and the Hulk's together into one. Romanoff, after hearing reports from Rhodes of an assassin that operates with similar methods to Barton, leaves to find him. Barton, consumed with grief after the loss of his family, has been operating under the mantle \"Ronin\" while brutally massacring criminal cartels and gangs around the world in order to try and improve the world that's still left. Natasha finds him in Japan and after some convincing, he agrees to rejoin the team in order to try and bring his family back.\n\nBanner and Rocket go to the small town of New Asgard, where Valkyrie and the last survivors of Asgard have settled. They there find Thor, who has become overwhelmed by guilt over failing to kill Thanos in Wakanda. Thor has become overweight, his hair and beard are overgrown, and he spends his free time eating junk food, getting drunk, and playing Fortnite with his friends Korg and Miek. Thor begrudgingly agrees to return to the Avengers after some convincing from Rocket and Banner.\n\nAfter testing the quantum time machine on Barton, who confirms that it works, The Avengers are reunited with a plan - Banner, Rogers, Lang, and Stark embark to retrieve the Time, Mind, and Space stones during the battle of New York in 2012. Banner goes to the Sanctum Sanctorum, where he is informed by the Ancient One that taking the Time Stone from her time line would prevent Stephen Strange's future efforts to stop Kaecilius from destroying the laws of nature. However, when Banner tells her that Strange gave up the Time Stone willingly to Thanos, she allows Banner to have it, implying Strange had intended for a specific sequence of events to occur for Thanos to be defeated. Banner also promises the stones' return to their proper time lines in order to prevent any ill effects. Lang and Stark attempt to steal the Space Stone after the Avengers confiscate it from Loki.\n\nLang gives Stark's past self a mild cardiac arrest by pulling a circuit in his artificial heart, while Stark steals the briefcase housing the Tesseract when nobody is looking. Their plan is thwarted when Stark drops the briefcase after he is accidentally hit by the Hulk. Loki then steals the Space Stone and uses it to escape custody. Rogers succeeds in stealing the Mind Stone from undercover Hydra agents, but stumbles across his past self, who mistakes him for a disguised Loki.\n\nAfter defeating past-Steve, Rogers meets back up with Stark and Lang, who now must figure out another way to get the Space Stone without running out of the limited supply of Pym Particles that allow them to travel through the quantum realm. Lang returns to the present with the Mind Stone while Rogers and Stark devise a plan to steal the Space Stone from a U.S. Army installation in the 1970s, while also stealing further vials of Pym Particles in order to make the journey back home. While there, Rogers sights Peggy Carter and Stark has an meaningful conversation with his father Howard.\n\nRocket and Thor travel to Asgard to retrieve the Reality Stone before Malekith uses it against the Nine Realms. While in Asgard, Thor is reminded that his mother, Frigga, would die soon and has a chance encounter with her while Rocket steals the Aether, the vaporized version of the Reality Stone, from Jane Foster. The two return to Earth after Frigga counsels Thor and he retrieves his hammer Mjolnor, elated to discover that he is still worthy of it.\n\nNebula and Rhodes travel to Morag to steal the Power Stone before Peter Quill does. As Rhodes returns to the present with the Power Stone, Nebula malfunctions and remains on Morag. With two consciousnesses operating on Nebula's systems, Thanos and Ebony Maw discover the presence of future Nebula and go to kidnap her. Nebula realizes what has happened and tries to warn the others, but is too late. Thanos scans her memories and discovers the Avengers' plan, and sends the more loyal past Nebula back to the present as a spy.\n\nBarton and Romanoff travel to Vormir to retrieve the Soul Stone, though are conflicted when Red Skull, keeper of the stone, informs them that it can only be retrieved by sacrificing someone they love. The two fight over which will make the sacrifice, with Romanoff ultimately taking the fall, while a distraught Barton returns to Earth with the Soul Stone.\n\nAfter everyone has returned to the present on Earth, Stark, Rocket, and Banner set out to craft a gauntlet to wield the stones, one constructed from the same nanotech of Stark's latest Iron Man suit. Banner volunteers himself to wield the gauntlet and bring back everyone that disappeared in Thanos' snap, reasoning that he can withstand both the gamma radiation and the immense pain and injury brought on by using the stones. He succeeds, though they are almost immediately attacked by Thanos, who has been brought to Earth by the impostor Nebula, destroying the quantum portal in the process.\n\nThanos reduces the Avengers headquarters to rubble, splitting the team up and causing the gauntlet to fall into Barton's protection. The past Nebula is killed by her future self as she attempts to take the Infinity Stones from Barton, while Rogers, Thor, and Stark confront Thanos, who decides he will instead use the Infinity Stones to destroy the universe and create one in his vision. The three fight Thanos one on one, with Rogers confirming Thor's theory that he is worthy of wielding Mjolnor, but are each bested by Thanos.\n\nSoon after Thanos' army lands on Earth, T'Challa appears before Rogers, along with all of the Avengers and other allies revived by Banner, before launching an assault on Thanos and his army. After a lengthy battle during which Stark is reunited with Parker and Quill is reunited with past Gamora, Thanos wrestles with numerous Avengers for the Infinity Stones.\n\nWhen he's bound by Wanda Maximoff's energy, Thanos orders Glaive to have his ship fire multiple energy blasts, nearly devastating the Avengers' efforts. Captain Marvel reappears, taking out Thanos' ship while fighting for control of the gauntlet. Using the nanotech from the new gauntlet, Stark maneuvers the Infinity Stones from Thanos' hand to his own and uses them to turn Thanos and his entire army into ash, triumphantly stating \"I am Iron Man.\" Parker and Potts console Stark as he dies from exposure to the Stones' radiation.\n\nFollowing the battle, The Avengers hold a funeral for Stark, whose Mark I arc reactor is floated out on the lake next to his house. Barton and Wanda Maximoff take solace in the fact that Romanoff and Vision, who did not return in the snap, would be proud of their victory over Thanos. Thor makes Valkyrie the Queen of Asgard and joins the Guardians of the Galaxy in order to find his true purpose, free of the burden of royalty and leadership for the first time in his life. Barton returns home to his family and Parker returns to school, where he is reunited with his best friend Ned.\n\nMeanwhile, Rogers is tasked to go into the past to return the stones and Thor's hammer to their original time-lines, but decides not to return to the present and to instead live the rest of his life in the past with Carter. He reappears before Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes as an old man, and passes his shield and the mantle of Captain America on to Wilson.\n\nA brief flashback shows Rogers and Carter in an ordinary-looking house, finally sharing the dance they never got to have in their living room, truly happy at last."

        "reviewText": "Infinity War is remembered mostly for how it ends, with good reason. But for me, the entire movie is incredible. Action, humor, cinematography, heartbreak, etc. It was a culmination of 10 years of character development. The benefit of that hard work? The movie can start with incredible action and never let up. Most wouldn't agree because of the ending, but I feel it's the best movie of the MCU (so far). Endgame was awesome, infinity war was better. I think the best part of it was the fact that we had so many cool character meet ups that as fans we never thought we'd see. Thor with the guardians? Wow. Star Lord and Iron Man? Rocket and the winter soldier? We could go on and on. They also mastered the art of humor to help offset some deep deep hurt throughout the story. Thor and Star Lords interactions are pure gold. Thor calling Rocket \"rabbit\" pure gold. Dr Strange and Tony going toe to toe is worth the price of admission as well. I'm going to stop now or I could type forever.\n\nMy only goal of writing this review is to help sway some others. Try to appreciate this movie for more than the gut wrenching ending. It's nonstop awesome from beginning to end. Enjoy!",

Of course, the film delivers impressive show values and action, but besides, it is above all the interactions of the characters that are well thought out. Surprisingly, no character is neglected, and all the storylines of the previous films are brought together amazingly logical. The end is for me one of the best cliffhangers of all time, after the movie I was whacked. In the end, I have to ask myself: What more do I expect from a comic book superhero film? I was perfectly happy, so I can also give a comic book adaptation 10 out of 10 stars.",

All of the characters were balanced seemingly effortlessly. The action was amazing. The characters were funny. The story was compelling. Marvel made what should've been an overcrowded mess into one of the best superhero films ever made.\n\nThis movie will sit you on the edge of your seat for 2 and a half hours.

        "reviewText": "Although this film has 'Avengers' in the title, it ultimately belongs to Thanos. It's his story that drives the whole plot. He is the main characters of this movie, not any of the heroes. Thanos in my opinion is the greatest villain the MCU has ever produced. as a character he is truly threatening. In most of these movies deep down I know the hero will always win. For the first time I wasn't sure if the hero would win or not. Through the movie's entirety I was on the edge of my seat wandering whether my favourite characters would actually make it out of the movie alive. To have a villain with that level of genuine threat I thought was fantastic. I also felt slightly conflicted by his motivations. On the face of it, planning to eliminate half the universe's population is obviously a bad thing; however, after we learn his motivations for wanting to do so, I'd be lying if I didn't say I understood where he was coming from. There are two tones at play in this movie. One of them is a comical tone, mostly coming from the Guardians, Thor and Spider-Man. Predominantly though this movie is dark. Because of the level of threat created by Thanos, there is an emotional aspect to this film that will take the viewer by surprise. There are plenty of large scale action sequences, which are amazing; but there are also some shocking moments that were difficult to deal with. What I can say is that, the running time of two and a half hours absolutely flew by.\n\n Overall, Avengers: Infinity War did well in balancing the screen time among the characters in a way that every member of the Avengers get at least a moment to shine. There are also lots of great action, comedy, performances and a massive cliffhanger at the end that is well earned.",

He is by far the most interesting MCU villain: strong, nuanced and perfectly performed by Brolin. This really is HIS movie. The film has a train like speed and one impressive sequence is followed by the next. Especially the banter between Thor and the Guardians and Iron Man vs Strange is what makes these Marvel films so fun to watch. Great climatic ending (a well ending...).

        "reviewText": "It was only after the release of Infinity War that I got interest in MCU. Before that I wasn't very much into superhero movies. So a couple of months after this movie released, I skimmed through all the MCU movies from Iron Man to Black Panther. I didn't put much focus into watching them all, since most of them were just following one pattern. Iron Man? A guy gets superpowers, beats the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and saves the day. Captain America? A guy gets superpowers, beats the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and saves the day. Thor? A guy \"loses\" and then gets superpowers, beats the bad guy and saves the day. Even in The Avengers and Age of Ultron it's just \"now all those guys come together, beat the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and save the day\". But Avengers: Infinity War is very much different.\n\nThe movie begins from where the post credit scene of Thor: Ragnarok ended. Loki dies in the very beginning of the movie while he was trying to unsuccessfully deceive Thanos. This clearly shows that this movie really means business. It's not afraid of killing off the characters we have grown to like in all these years. Thor's hammer has broken so he gets a Mjolnir. Meanwhile Iron Man's team faces Thanos in yet another very brutal attack. Captain America's team is able to get out of their imprisonment after the events of Captain America: Civil War. And in spite of having a huge threat looming before them, Captain America and Iron Man still feel guilty of what happened between them previously.\n\nThanos is undoubtedly the biggest threat to have ever been shown in any Marvel movie, MCU or otherwise. Unlike the comics where he's just simping behind Death to show how many people he can kill, this time he actually has a motivation. And that motivation is so powerful he is even ready to sacrifice his own daughter for it. He has fought for many years to find the Infinity Stones, and there is no way that he will sacrifice his lifetime work over morals or ethics. Concepts like humanity, empathy, conscience don't hold him back anymore, as he was brought up by the Eternals and in spite of being treated as one of them, he chose to part ways. Mortals don't matter to him anymore. His ambition does.\n\nEvery scene from this movie is shot very well. The story, the colour palette, the choreography, the costumes, the score, everything is absolutely perfect. The only part I had a problem with earlier was when Starlord learnt about Thanos having killed Gamora and then he punches Thanos till he wakes up and is stopped. But later on I realised that Starlord has always been an emotional crybaby, and this kind of a behaviour is absolutely suited on him. He cannot be expected to think rationally, considering his track record in both the previous Guardians of the Galaxy movies.\n\nAnd finally in the end when Thanos snapped his finger, half the universe was gone. Even though we did know that they are all going to come back, the emotions that were conveyed by the characters clearly gave signs that something bad will surely happen in the end. I won't be getting into the spoilers because I want to keep this review spoiler free. So if you haven't seen it yet, don't just see who all disappear. Notice how they react when they disappear.\n\nAvengers: Infinity War is the kind of the Avengers movie I always wanted to see. I really don't like how The Avengers and Age of Ultron have aged so terribly (just like Joss Whedon's credibility lol) because of how campy they look by today's standards. Sure they did hold their legacy back then, but Infinity War will hold it for decades. It's the best MCU movie of all time.",

Unlike any other marvel movie, this deserves to be praised for bringing around 25+ popular characters and putting them all in a cohesive narrative thats unlike anything that came before it.\n\nAt least 20 movies filled with characters and storyline nuances were successfully kept intact here yet the main character was the villain that had barely had any screentime previously, yet was written in a way that you could empathise with him and tied him into prior events like the new york invasion.\n\nThe movie itself is structured perfectly, from the perspective of Thanos putting him in a heroes journey making him go to different locations to collect the stones from different heroes weve come to know, and pairing different combinations of heroes in an insanely well written way so every character stood out and had an iconic moment to shine.\n\nAll in all the scope of this film is beyond anything that has come before it and even more so than Endgame, but they kept the narrative grounded and paced it perfectly. And the ending of the movie is one of the best endings ever. The best superhero/ comic book film of all time after The Dark Knight.",

As this movie was directed by the same guys as Winter Soldier and Civil War, I went into this movie with sky-high expectations. \n\nI am gonna keep this brief: Avengers: Infinity War blew me away! If I should mention just one thing that really amazed me was the character of Thanos. He is so well developed and makes for a super interesting and complex villain. As an audience, we are actually capable of sympathizing with a guy, who wants to kill off half of the universe. It's not about power or dominance. It's about preserving life in a Universe with finite resources - a goal with leads him (and the avengers) into several interesting moral dilemmas. \n\nI agree with the other reviews here. This movie is such a beautiful calamity of 10 years of the best superhero entertainment there is. Thinking about it, I can't really grasp how the director pulled this off. So many well developed characters from different story lines are working together in a true cinematic symphony. \n\nI give this movie my highest recommendations. It's a must-see for anyone with just a remote interest in the franchise.",

        "reviewText": "Over the past decade, Marvel has earned itself the benefit of the doubt. The studio has consistently delivered smart, funny, brave films that both embrace and transcend their comic-book origins. The 18 blockbuster movies produced since Iron Man first blasted off into the stratosphere in 2008 have not only reinvented superhero films as a genre - they've helped to legitimise it. Indeed, Marvel's two most recent films - Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther - have received the kind of accolades usually reserved for edgy arthouse flicks. \n\nAnd yet, it's perfectly reasonable to be apprehensive about Avengers: Infinity War. This is a blockbuster film that's been ten years in the making, its plot hinted at and scattered throughout 18 other movies. It features 30 or so characters, each with their own complex backstories and motivations. And all of them are coming together in a bid to stop a giant purple alien dude from destroying the universe. It sounds ridiculous, and feels impossible. \n\nBut that's precisely what makes the final product such a monumental achievement. Masterfully directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, Infinity War is bold, brainy filmmaking at its very best: the kind that will lift your spirits, blow your mind and shatter your soul - occasionally in the same scene. It demonstrates on an epic scale what Marvel has known all along: that special effects and tightly choreographed action are there to serve the story. For all its blockbuster spectacle (and there's almost too much of that), the film works because it's anchored by the heart, humour and humanity of its characters.\n\nThe film's basic plot is simple: Thanos (played via motion-capture by Josh Brolin), intergalactic purveyor of death and destruction, has long been on the hunt for the six Infinity Stones that will give him complete control over the elemental building blocks of the universe. He dispatches his acolytes to Earth to retrieve the Time Stone, currently in the possession of Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and carve the Mind Stone out of the forehead of Vision (Paul Bettany). It's a literal existential threat so terrifying that all the heroes we've come to know and love - from the Avengers to the Guardians of the Galaxy - must put aside their differences and unite against a common foe. \n\nFrom the outset, it's immediately clear that neither the film's directors nor screenwriters (Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) are interested in playing it safe. Most other superhero films are bled of high stakes - the hero in the title might suffer untold trauma, but it's a super-safe bet that he or she will make it to the end alive. There's no such guarantee here. Within the first ten minutes, we are confronted with the dark, twisted depths to which Thanos and his acolytes in the Black Order will sink in order to achieve their goals. Death, as well as genuine loss and sacrifice, is intrinsic to the narrative drumbeat that drives Infinity War ever forward, and the film is all the better for it. \n\nThat's not to say the movie is a morbid and depressing experience. What's so impressive about Infinity War is how it expertly juggles its constantly shifting tones and moods. When it's funny (and it very often is), it's deeply, truly funny. The film finds maximum joy in flinging characters together with merry abandon, mixing and matching ones you'd never have expected to share scenes or trade banter. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is floored by Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) godly muscles. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) is charmed by the wit and intelligence of Shuri (Letitia Wright). And it'd be impossible to not be utterly delighted by Peter Dinklage's inspired cameo. It's a blithely tongue-in-cheek sensibility shared by Marvel's best comic books, which understand that humour can make you care when it really counts.\n\nAnd, boy, does Infinity War make it count. There are many heartbreakingly human moments threaded throughout the film: from the charming surrogate father-son dynamic shared by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Peter Parker (Tom Holland), to the undeniable love that ties Vision and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) together. In many ways, the film stands as a testament to the human capacity not just to love, but to love fiercely and beyond all logic. It's right there when the unfailingly noble Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) declares, \"We don't trade lives\", even when giving up one could save billions. \n\nThere's even a chilling echo of it in Thanos himself. A lesser film would have turned Thanos into a one-dimensional villain, much the way he's all monster and maniac in the comic books. In Infinity War, however, Thanos' end goal is surprisingly relevant when it comes to thinking and talking about the staggeringly overpopulated world in which we live today. There is, as it turns out, method to Thanos' madness. It makes the tragic twists and turns in his relationships with his estranged adopted daughters, Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and Nebula (Karen Gillan), all the more unsettling. \n\nFor the most part, Infinity War does justice, too, to the many heroes who have been assembled for the film. The Russo brothers displayed great skill at interweaving multiple perspectives and character trajectories in Captain America: Civil War, and they do so again here, with twice as many characters. Even the most minor of supporting players, like Don Cheadle's James Rhodes/War Machine, are given story beats that land. It helps that Marvel has always taken care to cast genuinely good actors in roles that might otherwise come off as silly and slight. \n\nEven so, there are a few standouts amongst this enormous and enormously talented cast. Emotionally speaking, this is Downey's film. He plays every note of Tony's reluctant courage and bone-deep trauma, as he embarks on what he's convinced is a suicide mission. He's ably matched by Cumberbatch, who finds vulnerability even in his character's most cunning and calculative move. Hemsworth, meanwhile, is given free rein to import the big-hearted comedic swagger of Thor: Ragnarok into this film - while also layering it with a deeply-felt, jagged grief for the losses he has suffered at the hands of Thanos and the universe.\n\nIn a film with so many moving parts, some elements don't work quite as well. A couple of characters that you might have expected to be right at the forefront - including an original Avenger or two - fade into the background. The film tumbles from dizzying fight scene to dizzying fight scene, and while most of them are fantastically choreographed, there are some purely dumb moments that literally revolve around attempts to prevent Thanos from clenching his fist. In effect, this is a superhero m√™l√©e that's part over-the-top and part overkill, and might prove too much for those who don't already care for this franchise and the characters in it.\n\nMinor quibbles aside, though, Infinity War is yet another step in the right direction for Marvel. It continues the studio's tradition of placing a premium on rich, complex storytelling that respects both its characters and its audiences. But it also refuses to make things easy for itself. The film ends even more bravely than it began, with a final ten minutes that will haunt and horrify you in equal measure. It's a stroke of bold, brilliant genius - a narrative risk so audacious that you'll want to follow Marvel wherever it goes next.",

It is very easy on the most part to see why they are highly regarded critically, though those more critical of their work have raised criticisms that can be agreed with by me. \n\nLoved the first 'Avengers' film, while 'Age of Ultron' was more problematic and generally a lesser Marvel effort though still having a good deal to admire. 'Infinity War' for me was the best one, or the one enjoyed most. Would also go far to say it's one of Marvel's overall best, and a perfect example of how to do a superhero film and how to balance a large cast of characters and a lot going on. Can totally see why it has been so positively reviewed and it deserves the positive hype from personal opinion, though would hesitate in calling it flawless or one of the best films ever. \n\nMore could have been done with the very end, which felt like it ended a little too suddenly without resolving everything to full effect. It may very well have been leaving room for a follow-up, but to me it's always been dangerous somewhat to do that just in case a follow-up doesn't happen.\n\nScarlett Johansson also has far too little to do, with too short screen-time. Black Widow is the only character to me who felt underdeveloped and Johansson struggles to do much with it.\n\nHowever, the rest of the cast are spot on. A big shout out goes to Josh Brolin, who makes for a menacing and melancholic Thanos. Speaking of Thanos, Marvel have tended to underwhelm with their villains, underwriting them and giving them vague or inconsistent motivations. Thanos is easily one of the best Marvel villains along with Hela, one of the most interesting and of surprising complexity where he is a threat but one can see his point of view.\n\nRobert Downey Jnr, Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth are also standouts of a near-uniformly great all-star cast. There are a lot of characters here, but somehow on the most part it didn't feel like there were too many (a big danger with films with many characters and a trap fallen into quite a lot). They hold a lot of intrigue and manage not to be too sided and true to character. \n\nLikewise, the story is very eventful with a busy main story and several subplots. Yet it didn't feel sprawling and managed to make sense and never lose engagement. Basically it's a non-stop thrill-ride and tautly paced, with some reveals that leaves one gasping, twists that genuinely shock, rousing entrances and some of the finest action sequences of any Marvel film or any film recently, that are truly exciting and big in scale without being too noisy or exhausting. The climax is truly epic, in scale, spectacle, thrills and emotion. \n\n'Avengers: Infinity War' hugely impresses in the script too, with snappy banter, hilarious quips (along with 'Thor: Ragnarok' this is one of the funniest Marvel films, Thor has the best of it), tension and an emotional poignancy not seen to this extent or as strongly in Marvel films. It's all intelligently handled and the humour didn't feel misplaced or inappropriate to me, this is a Marvel film that delivers on the spectacle and thrills while also having brains and heart. \n\nMarvel never disappoints when it comes to the production values. 'Avengers: Infinity War' is not an exception. It's beautifully and atmospherically designed, slickly filmed and edited and the special effects, not overused or abused, are some of the most extravagant and spectacular for any film seen recently. It's tightly directed and dynamically and rousingly scored. \n\nOverall, an excellent film and one of my standout viewings of all the films seen so far from the first half, and overall, of 2018. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

        "reviewText": "Let me be clear Infinity War is not flawless, it has its faults but thankfully they are overshadowed by two hours of awesomeness.\n\nEvery movie in the Marvel universe for the last decade has ultimately been building up to this therefore expectations were through the roof and for the most part it delivers.\n\nAlmost every character from the MCU teams up to face its most dangerous foe yet, the mad titan himself Thanos and if you know anything about the comics then going in you'd know to brace yourself for heartache.\n\nWith all the hype as to who wouldn't survive the film I'm left wondering just how many deaths are permanent, this is a superhero universe after all so never say never.\n\nThough the story and Thanos's motivations differ from the comic this can be forgiven as the new story is wafer thin but competent.\n\nAs you can imagine one of the most exciting things about Infinity War was uniting heroes we've never seen side by side and that certainly delivers on all fronts. The action is thick and fast, despite the dark overtone we have plenty of comedy and teenage Groot didn't ruin the film like I feared he would.\n\nObviously this is not a big finale and merely a high profile chapter in a much larger story but the movie is highly climatic regardless.\n\nI am saddened that this wasn't a two parter, alike Civil War (2016) this was a huge story and perhaps should have been broken up across movies.\n\nInfinity War is a contender for the best Marvel movie and instead of feeling burnt out after the never ending stream of films this has wet my appetite for more and I can't wait for the next film.\n\nExcellent stuff, though where in the blue hell was Ant Man?\n\nThe Good:\n\nChildren of Thanos\n\nThanos\n\nAll out action as expected\n\nTies everything together nicely\n\nThe Bad:\n\nPeter Dinklage (Never thought I'd say that)\n\nSo many characters were spread too thin\n\nThings I Learnt From This Movie:\n\nIf Thanos and Cable ever meet its going to be super weird\n\nDishonest footage/photos are commonplace now (Look up the footage of Hulk in Wakanda running with the rest of the team) Seriously, never happened.\n\nSomewhere out there right now are DC fans claiming this is a bad film",

I think the movie is so great because it contains almost everything you could ask (action, humor, heartfelt moments, great CGI, fantastic score, ...) in a balanced way. Furthermore even if the culmination of the MCU happened in \"Endgame\" it was here that every piece of the Marvel Universe was brought together for the first time. I remember to have an astronomical hype at the time and the fact that the movie resulted to be even better than what my hype was making envisioning me is something that I highly count. But the best part of this movie is its villain, Thanos. I loved him (and still do) and he absolutely stole the show and sets up Endgame perfectly. Clearly \"Infinity War\" has its flaws and I am not here to say it is perfect like a 10/10 rating would usually mean, but for what it represented at the time and the way it was delivered I think we couldn't have asked for more.",

Since then I kind of lost interest in Marvel movies in general, as their quality was very variable, with a few gems here and there. Ultimately in hindsight, the MCU is a really fun and generally well-made series of movies, with the persistent flaw of deflated stakes, contradicting rules and muddled plot points. Not quite brainless entertainment per se, but sometimes feels like that.\n\nAvengers Infinity War reignited my interest in the MCU, as the movie itself was really well done in pretty much every way. It's genuinely a very strong movie, that is deeply rewatchable, and one of the best Space movies ever made.",

        "reviewText": "Summer movies often hype themselves as spectacular events not to be missed and their ad campaigns use words like \"epic\", \"spectacle\", and \"smash\" as ways to build the hype to increase advanced box office sales. The summer 2018 film season kicks off in a big way with \"Avengers: Infinity War\" and it is the rare summer film that exceeds is lofty expectations and delivers a crowning achievement for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. When Thanos (Josh Brolin), embarks on a deadly campaign to find and possess the Infinity Stones, he leaves a path of death and destruction in his path. When his pursuit leading him to Earth, Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), who enlist a reluctant Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), to the cause just as the minions of Thanos arrive. With The Avengers fractured and scattered following the events of \"Captain America: Civil War\" the teams find themselves dealing with the threat in various groups as fate steps in to divide many key members of the team. This allows for a great entry by the Guardians of the Galaxy and allows the film to take a very enjoyable path. Essentially the movie weaves separate storylines into one cohesive and very satisfying epic. You have a story with the Guardians as well as one with many of the key Avengers, as well as others with characters old and new. As such it is like a Guardians, Avengers, and Marvel film all rolled into one and each one supports the other very well yet has the charm and identity you would expect. While the tone is very dark as you would expect with literally half of the known universe facing destruction, there is also some solid humor in the film that never once undermines the story or pacing. Naturally the effects are stunning as you would expect as Marvel has put a significant amount of money into the film and it shows in every eye-popping action sequence. What really impressed me the most was that the Russo Brothers never let the FX of the film overshadow the characters and with a very large cast, it was nice to see everyone got their moment and you did not see members of the cast trying to one up each other. There are some real surprise moments along the way and the action is easily the best of any Marvel film to date. Many fans had expressed disappointment with \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" for me this film is significantly better than the prior film and is everything that a Marvel fan would want in a film. I was also surprised by how well Thanos was portrayed as while you hopefully will not agree with his deductions and methods; you could actually understand his motivations and it help him transcend from the usual megalomaniacs which are so common in films of his type. I am really looking forward to seeing what comes next and make sure you stay through the credits for a bonus scene. Believe the hype, \"Avengers: Infinity War\" is an epic not to be missed and is an example of what a summer event film should be. 5 stars out of 5",

      "text": "SPOILER: Thanos and his Children - Proxima Midnight, Ebony Maw, Corvus Glaive and Cull Obsidian - have attacked Thor's Asgardian ship in search of the Space Stone, which is housed in the Tesseract that Loki had stolen before Asgard's destruction. With Thanos already possessing the Power Stone after decimating Xandar, Thanos' army swiftly defeats the Asgardians. After a futile counter-attack from the Hulk, Loki offers the Tesseract to Thanos in exchange for Thor's life - only to be killed himself when Thanos anticipates Loki's attempt to betray and kill him. Moments before Glaive kills him, Heimdall uses the power of the Bifrost to send Hulk to Earth. Thanos and his Children then depart just after Thanos uses the Power stone to destroy the ship, leaving a mourning Thor behind and stranded in space.\n\nHulk crash lands at the Sanctum Sanctorum in New York City and is reverts back to Bruce Banner, who informs Stephen Strange and Wong about Thanos' impending arrival. Strange and Banner contact Tony Stark and brief him about the Infinity Stones and Thanos. Realizing they must find Vision to protect the Mind Stone embedded in his head, Stark realizes he must make contact with Steve Rogers to find Vision, who has gone off the grid with Wanda Maximoff. Just then, Maw and Obsidian arrive in New York to seize the Time Stone from Strange, and Stark, Strange, Wong and Peter Parker confront them. Having been traumatized by his defeat at the hands of Thanos, Banner finds himself unable to transform into the Hulk and help in the battle. Maw incapacitates and captures Strange; Stark and Parker pursue his spaceship off Earth while Wong stays behind to protect the Sanctorum. Banner contacts the rest of the Avengers.\n\nIn Scotland, where Wanda Maximoff and Vision have been hiding, the two are ambushed by Midnight and Glaive, but Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff and Sam Wilson fight them off. They decide to seek shelter in the Avengers Facility in Upstate New York, where they meet James Rhodes, who is once again mobile with bionic leg braces. Vision proposes that Maximoff destroy the Stone in his forehead to keep Thanos from retrieving it. Wanda immediately refuses however Rogers suggests that they travel to the one place that has the technology to safely remove the stone from Vision without killing him: Wakanda.\n\nThor is rescued by the Guardians of the Galaxy, who had picked up the Asgardian ship's distress call. Thor guesses that Thanos would next be after the Reality Stone, which is in the possession of the Collector in Knowhere, but first he must retrieve a new weapon capable of killing Thanos from the dwarven planet of Nidavellir, where the only forge that can create such a weapon exists. Thor orders Rocket with him to Nidavellir, while Peter Quill, Gamora, Drax and Mantis travel to Knowhere. On the way there, Gamora talks to Quill, making him promise to kill her if the situation presents itself. Quill reluctantly promises he will. In Knowhere, Thanos ambushes the Guardians, having already retrieved the Reality Stone and created an illusion of an intact Knowhere to trap them. He captures Gamora after a crucial moment when Gamora begs Quill to kill her, using the Space Stone to escape. Thanos reveals that he knows that Gamora already knows the location of the Soul Stone after prying information from a tortured Nebula. Nebula escapes and signals the remaining Guardians to meet her on Titan, Thanos' home world. Thanos and Gamora travel to the planet of the Soul Stone, Vormir, where the Red Skull, the Stone's keeper, informs him that retrieving the Stone carries a heavy price: it can only be retrieved by sacrificing the life of someone he truly loves. Despite his reluctance, Thanos tearfully throws Gamora off a tall cliff to her death and is granted the Soul Stone.\n\nStark and Parker rescue Strange from Maw's torture chamber, and launch Maw out of the ship, killing him. Strange believes they should retreat to protect the Time Stone but Stark disagrees; he believes they should take the fight to Thanos instead of retreating like they've done in the past. The three leave to confront Thanos on Titan, where they meet Quill, Drax and Mantis and formulate a plan to remove Thanos' gauntlet. While discussing their tactics, Strange uses the Time Stone to view alternate futures, telling them he'd seen 14,000,605 of them, with only one where the Avengers win. Thanos teleports to Titan, where, after a brief conversation with Strange meant to distract him, the group engage Thanos hand-to-hand and manage to subdue him. Mantis is able to calm Thanos while Peter and Tony attempt to pry the gauntlet from his arm. Quill and Nebula, who'd arrived on Titan during the battle, deduce that Gamora is dead; an enraged Quill retaliates, hitting Thanos and breaking the group's hold on him. Thanos takes the gauntlet back and defeats the group, threatening to kill Stark unless Strange gives him the Time Stone. Strange does so and tells Tony they've \"entered the end game.\" Thanos adds the stone to his gauntlet and departs Titan.\n\nThor, Rocket and Groot arrive at an abandoned and desolate Nidavellir. Thor is puzzled that the giant forge is inactive. The giant dwarf Eitri tells them that Thanos forced the dwarves to create his gauntlet; in return, Thanos killed all the dwarves except for Eitri. After laboring to reactivate the forge and reignite the neutron star that powers it, the four create Stormbreaker, a battle axe that serves as Thor's new weapon and grants him the power of the Bifrost. Meanwhile, the Avengers arrive in Wakanda and task Shuri with safely extracting the Mind Stone from Vision. Thanos' Outrider army arrives and begins attacking Wakanda, and the Avengers, alongside the united Wakandan armies led by King T'Challa, mount a defense against Thanos' forces. Glaive infiltrates Shuri's lab and attacks Vision. The Outriders begin overwhelming the defending armies before Thor, Rocket and Groot arrive to join the battle. The tide seems to be turning for the Avengers, Midnight, Obsidian and Glaive are killed, but Thanos arrives for the Mind Stone. A tearful Maximoff destroys the still-implanted Mind Stone in Vision to prevent Thanos from retrieving it, but Thanos uses the Time Stone to reverse the event and pry out the Mind Stone from Vision, killing him again. Thor attacks and drives Stormbreaker into Thanos' chest, but Thanos survives long enough to snap his fingers with the gauntlet. On a faraway world he finds Gamora as a child. When he confirms that he achieved his goal, she asks him what it cost. His answer is \"Everything.\" Back on Earth, Thor looks on in horror as Thanos, his gauntlet now battered from the effort and his left arm and part of his chest burned, teleports away.\n\nThanos' goal of eradicating half of all life in the universe comes to fruition as people begin disintegrating: Bucky Barnes, T'Challa, Groot, Maximoff, Wilson, Mantis, Drax, Star Lord, Strange & Parker all turn to ash and fade away. In Wakanda, only Rogers, Thor, Banner, Romanoff, James Rhodes, Rocket, Okoye and M'Baku remain of the heroes. On Titan, only Nebula and Stark are left alive. Thanos awakens on another lush, green planet, his chest wound healed, and serenely watches the sunset, smiling slightly, satisfied at having achieved his ultimate goal.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, the Earth is in chaos as people begin dissolving into ash; driver-less cars crash on the street and a helicopter is seen crashing into a skyscraper and exploding. Former S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury and Deputy Director Maria Hill witness the scene on the street before they dissolve themselves. Before he vanishes, Fury manages to send a final distress signal to Captain Marvel."

        "reviewText": "Essentially an origin story, this was exactly how I remembered reading the Captain America comic books when I was younger, mostly sticking around how the sickly Steve Rogers (a CG- ed Chris Evans) became the beefcake he was through a top secret military experiment, and his constant battles with his arch nemesis standing for all things Axis powered personified by the Red Skull, played to perfection by Hugo Weaving with a German accented voice as the Johann Schmidt version. At its heart it's a clear cut battle between good and evil, although in this Marvel augmented reality, Evil is aided by the powers of the Cosmic Cube and the megalomaniacal ambitions of Red Skull and his Hydra shock troops, threatening to conquer the globe unless someone can do something about it.\n\nHence the first act concentrated on the innate characteristic of Steve Rogers, a determined, never say die young chap from Brooklyn whose enlistment to the US Army has consistently been met with flat out rejections, until the scientist Dr Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) saw something in him that no one else does, and selects him as the first of intended many in the army's Super Soldier project, as headed by Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jomes). It's almost a master-prot√©g√© relationship set up in their short scenes together, but made no less powerful with nice touches about what really mattered in a world that's embroiled in a massive war.\n\nSince there's always nothing too definitive out there as far as origin stories go in the comics world, it's admirable how Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely's screenplay still managed to extract the essence of the character, of what made him tick as the beacon amongst the do gooders, and explored how events pushed the man into donning the less than camouflaged colours into combat. Allies like Howard Stark (now played by Dominic Cooper) whom we've seen in the expanded Marvel universe of films in Iron Man 2 as the military's main contractor, Bucky (Sebastian Stan) as Steve's best friend, and Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter the British agent and romantic love interest, all factored in to build Captain America's world, which if a sequel is made would be a challenge to try and set it in the 40s again since the events here were pretty much open and close.\n\nAction wise, while Captain America essentially doesn't possess super powers per se, still is the epitome of physical fitness, and Joe Johnston compensates this with large, and I mean large action sequences, coupled with plenty of montage to show the Captain's campaign against evil. And I thought there was a conscious effort to tone down the \"America\"ness of a one man crusade, and assembled a rag tag group of United Nations typed mercenaries whose loyalty is to the Captain since he busted them out from near death. His trademark Vibranium shield worked out very nicely in the fights, choreographed just as how one would imagine the real Captain America do it, with the shield featuring heavily in all fights designed that it's more than a good looking prop. I'd even appreciated effort to include the original shield Cap America used, together with a more logical reason how he had to don a cheesy looking costume that doesn't make camouflage sense, worked into emerging as an icon to rally behind in the face of adversity.\n\nSubtlety is one of the key strengths of the film, with Captain America's additional and lesser known abilities mentioned in passing but enough for fans to pick up, with numerous references in this film that's set up to reference the other Marvel films from Iron Man to Thor. While the romantic angle was severely limited, I thought the emotional resonance worked particularly well especially if you know how the Cap would eventually end up, in a way fixed by the mythos and unavoidable, being the romance that had potential and room to develop further.\n\nSome may say that a superhero film gets defined by the villain, but this one clearly didn't let its villain upstage the heroic character, which is quite rare. Not that Hugo Weaving did a bad job with Red Skull, but there are little evil deeds the Skull had significantly embarked upon besides pulverizing his opponents with no remorse, and his constant banter with scientist Dr Amim Zola (Toby Jones) to show just how egoistical he could be. Hopefully we will get to see more of the Red Skull in future sequels of Captain America, since Chris Evans signed for a total of 6 appearances. Evans too while being involved in too many comic book films as compared to Ryan Reynolds, will probably be best remembered for his Captain America outing than for his less charismatic Johnny Storm in the Fantastic Four, and balanced both the drama and hard hitting action well, believable as the man you'd trust to rally the troops and lead them in the fight against evil.\n\nCaptain America: The First Avenger ranks up there amongst the comic book based movies done right even if the storyline comes up as somewhat expected given its necessity to focus on the hero's origins. This is undoubtedly highly recommended, and as always, don't leave before the end credits have rolled off, for the first look at Joss Whedon's The Avengers, and from the looks of it, it's going to be one heck of a ride, especially when mega egos come clashing up against one another. Summer 2012 can't come any sooner!",

        "reviewText": "Considering how fundamentally 'safe' the superhero action film has become in terms of box office and reasonable standards of entertainment, selling Captain America, age-old icon of American propaganda on cinema screens in cynical and economically unstable times could hardly have been a more difficult endeavor ‚Äì tellingly, the film was marketed simply as The First Avenger in Russia, the Ukraine and South Korea. Indeed, skepticism and uncertainty have riddled the development of the project, which was first pitched as a Jon Favreau \"action comedy\" and later as a brutal, gritty, self-critical postmodern war epic. Such tonal fluctuation mirroring the social/political climate demonstrated that having a successful film with such a politically entwined protagonist, was anything but 'safe' ‚Äì it's hard to imagine Peter Parker being subjected to the scrutiny of \"military propaganda\" or \"patriotic cheese\" that beset Steve Rogers. \n\nWith this in mind, all the more credit can be given to Spielberg-cohort Joe Johnson for delivering what is ultimately the first comic book film that properly feels like a cartoon brought to life. Pitching strictly for nostalgia, Johnson bravely girds his film with the unabashed gee-wiz charm and heart of a 1940s Saturday morning adventure serial. In the process, without consistently tripping over political correctness, Johnson neatly circumvents concerns of propagandistic exploitation by delivering a film too bombastic, too colourful, too cheerily old-fashioned to be taken seriously enough as any kind of coy ideological manipulation. It's hard to imagine any contemporary audiences, cine-literate or not, being swayed to join the army by witnessing Captain America's hilariously cringe-worthy war bonds tour, arguably the film's strongest and most self-aware sequence. Even a couple of brazenly Spielbergian montages - conflating Captain America's early triumphs or the Red Skull's past crimes into a series of dramatic snapshots - somehow function as endearing and in keeping with the boldly cheerful feel, as Johnson keeps the pace whipping along with an engaging sprightly bounce, accompanied by Alan Silvestri's soaringly heroic musical score. \n\nIndeed, Captain America comes across as more of a vintage science-fiction adventure than war film, as Johnson channels the sort of deliriously cartoonish aesthetic, weapons and technology of 1940s serials, including lavish set design that would do any James Bond evil mastermind proud. Curiously, Johnson's film works in some surprisingly intense action, (including one of the more unexpectedly gruesome deaths in a comic book film), exploring Captain America's comparatively 'grounded' superhuman abilities to the effect of some of the most gripping fight scenes in recent memory, alternating tightly choreographed beat downs while adding the intriguing new dimension of his ricocheting shield to keep the action nuanced. Between the tidily doled out combat (including unique, visually dynamic showdowns between Nazi-scientist sect Hydra and the US army) and the film's encompassing virtually every form of chase scene (car, foot, submarine, motorcycle, train, helicopter, airplane and even zip-lining), there is ample material to appease any expectations for summer spectacle. \n\nNonetheless, Johnson's film is not, despite its glossy cartoon finish, without its faults. Despite the thundering action, the film may prove too over-the-top for those disinclined to filter through a haze of charming nostalgia. Similarly, throwback cartoonish fun and self-aware irony aside, some viewers may still find it impossible to shake the notion of watching a distasteful two hour army recruitment video. Additionally, like predecessor Thor, the film does lose its footing somewhat as it approaches the climax, and its juggling the emotional demands of a stand-alone narrative while still bridging the transition towards the upcoming superhero epic The Avengers may prove unsettling for non-comic fans. Nonetheless, Johnson admirably reconciles the two, grinding the whiz-bang cheerfulness of his film to a halt with a jarring, quietly tragic ending that, miraculously, proves oddly appropriate in spite of its discordance. Either way, if ever there were a film this year worth sitting out the ending credits, this would be the one. \n\nChris Evans as the iconic \"star-spangled man with the plan\" proves the film's greatest boon. Muting his customary swagger without sacrificing his overflowing charisma, Evans concocts an effortless blend between earnestness and underhanded humour, that makes his transition from good-hearted scrawny loser to unexpected patriotic icon somehow feel incredibly believable, sympathetic and appealing, thus selling the whole film. The fact that Evans can tackle moments such as a \"this is why we fight\" speech, saddled with a nearly absurd CGI- shrunken body, with a straight face and without a false note, and transition to asking his best buddy \"Are you ready to follow Captain America into the jaws of hell?\" with a perfect a quiver of world-weary, witty, self-mockery in his voice, demonstrates a masterfully conscious and nuanced performer delivering his most assured work yet. \n\nHowever, Johnson wisely surrounds Evans with a truly impressive supporting cast, each inhabiting their cheerfully one-note characters with enthusiasm to spare. Hugo Weaving masticates scenery with appropriate preening oiliness as the dastardly Red Skull, and Hayley Atwell and Sebastian Stan inhabit love interest Peggy Carter and best buddy Bucky Barnes with laudable presence and credibility. Tommy Lee Jones has a ball wryly clashing with the film around him as Rogers' military superior, and scene-stealer Stanley Tucci infuses the film with warmth and wit as the scientist behind Rogers' super soldier transformation. Dominic Cooper triumphantly bubbles over with charisma, charm and quirky humour worthy of his superheroic son as master inventor Howard Stark, while Toby Jones slithers with welcome relish as the Red Skull's chief scientist Arnim Zola. \n\nWhile the true make-or-break of the character will depend on his exploration in a contemporary context by Joss Whedon in The Avengers, it is hard to imagine a more appropriate or enjoyable character introduction. Consider Captain America as Indiana Jones' square-jawed uncle ‚Äì bold enough to demonstrate, by example, the role and function of a national icon, yet retrospectively wise enough to stick to its guns and striving for pure entertainment. Such an unabashed dash of fun is worthy of 'recruiting' viewers everywhere. \n\n-9/10",

        "reviewText": "In preparation for its 'Avengers' who assemble next year, Marvel Comics ends the super- heroes showdown this year with its final prequel about the origins of 'Captain America' ‚Äì the leader of the Avengers. Unlike the hi-tech flamboyance of 'Ironman', the might and super power of 'Thor' and the destructive temper of 'The Incredible Hulk', Captain America has little to offer but his devout patriotism and impenetrable shield as a hero. However, what makes him the captain, is the quintessential quality of compassion within the weakling Steve Rogers, that values both strength and power. After shrinking the kids, playing a live board game, recalling dinosaurs and creating werewolves in his movies, director Joe Johnston takes us back to the World War II era when in the midst of the Nazi turmoil, a country sent its troops to war with one hero, who would save the day for America. \n\nThe diminutive Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) never gave up on a fight in the alleys. Being rejected several times by the U.S. Army due to his short and skinny stature was hardly a discouragement. Nothing stopped this patriot from repeated attempts and finally he was enlisted upon the recommendation of a German military scientist (Stanley Tucci). He soon became a part of an experiment that enhanced his strength and capability with a serum that made him the first and last of a new breed of super-heroes. Helpless with just one experimental recruit, Colonel Phillip (Tommy Lee Jones) insists on Steve staying out of war as just one hero would do no good. The tall and muscular Steve now sells war bonds while dancing on stage in various cities as Captain America. After much humiliation and insult, Captain decides to cross enemy lines and play a greater role by overcoming bullies such as the Nazi Red Skull (Hugo Weaving), whose Hydra initiative is aimed at world dominance. \n\nCaptain America's adventure feels like Indiana Jones in its action sequences and at times like a James Bond movie with an ambitious villain who could dominate the world. At times, even the patriotism that is portrayed, can be overwhelming but then, our hero has to justify his name..... The problem here is that Captain America's back story seems to be a mandatory feature needed as a build up to 'The Avengers'. Although its period setting provides a richer backdrop for a super-hero story, one fails to engage deeply with the Captain's motives, emotions and powers. Without his impenetrable Vibranium shield, he is just a stronger human without any powers. Will he be greeted upon his entry in 'The Avengers' with the same fan- fare that Ironman, Hulk and Thor receive? Certainly not. He may have exceptional leadership capabilities through his mild, good-hearted nature but what is a leader without a team? That is what the movie fails to address and ends up being just another super-hero movie. \n\nHugo Weaving's malicious plans of world dominance remind us of many European accented James Bond villains but, with a Hellboy appearance. He has played better roles than this one throughout his career and with a weak plot for world dominance, he has little to dominate on screen no matter how good he can be. Hayley Atwell as Agent Peggy Carter is dismal in her performance. Seldom has an actress portrayed such a straight face that became so forgettable. Tommy Lee Jones is fun to watch because he has the most vivacious character and Stanley Tucci, in his brief appearance is impressionable. Chris Evans is remarkable in his CGI enhanced (?) skinny version where his unfailing ambition is marred by his physical limitations. He is equally smooth in funny moments as he is when he is physically challenged in the Army training. Once he goes through his transition, it's as if he is a different actor altogether. Unaccustomed to his height and strength, it is fun to watch him realize his own potential. As a super-hero in combat, he is just like any other. Straight faced, muscled-up and awesome. \n\nJoe Johnston's Captain America isn't an exceptional movie. It's a good, passable summer movie with loads of patriotism and historic appeal that nurture our hero. The film's concluding minutes will be the one that resonates through the audiences but otherwise, it won't disappoint critics, nor will it draw applause from the fans. In the Marvel world, X-Men still rule supreme but there is a new team lurking around the corner of 2012 and it's led by a strong man with a bullet-proof shield.....\n\n7.818 on a scale of 1-10.",

Tommy Lee Jones plays an excellent Colonel. Meanwhile evil Nazi Hugo Weaving believing he is Darth Maul, has his own plans for world conquest using sharks with frickin' laser beams. (Just kidding about the sharks.) Rogers is a 90 pound weakling who displays intellect, courage, and guts. He is selected for the military's secret program and is transformed into a muscular super hero. The special effects were very good, although we do know from \"Last Action Hero\" you can't really jump around car roofs. After Rogers is transformed he becomes Captain America to be used as a recruiting tool, as Tommy Lee still has his doubts about the 90 pound weakling.\n\nOf course things change and the rest of the story shouldn't be too hard to figure out, even if you don't read comics. Now the very end utilizes the one-eyed Samuel L. Jackson from Iron Man 2 which hints at an ultimate sequel providing everyone isn't dead by then.\n\nThe movie combines action, drama, light comedy, and light romance. Good acting, good dialogue, good frickin' laser beams.\n\nNo swearing, nudity, or sex.",

It's the best big budget movie that I've seen this year. It hits a high standard of excellence by combining a cool plot, breathtaking action sequences, a heavy dose of self discovery and realization, charisma, a dash of patriotism, love and puts it all together in one amazing package. This movie will surprise a lot of people with its heart while sacrificing none of the fun. The inner turmoil worked well, the beautiful thing is that we can relate to each character, especially that of underdog Steve Rogers. His never say die attitude and heart of a champion makes this hero more interesting then most. Captain America delivers on every level and does so with great emotional moments and it's a movie that lives up to all the hype it has generated.\n\nEverything has converged perfectly, delivering what is now the best summer movie season in recent memory. It's certainly the best overall summer for superheroes. The cast is obviously stellar but that doesn't always mean greatness. (American Gangster, Wanted, Sphere, etc.) I'm happy to say this amazing cast delivers in every way. Believe it or not, Chris Evans himself delivers one of the greatest performances in a comic adaptation film EVER. Maybe it's because the character itself is one of the most complex and intriguing that any genre has to offer but that doesn't diminish just what a home run Evans has hit. They took the character seriously but still remembered to include fun and humor. I almost can't convey how much I enjoyed this film.",

        "reviewText": "With the imminent \"Avengers\" movie coming next year, only one hero's origin story remains untold¬Öuntil now. Falling in line with \"Thor,\" \"Iron Man,\" and \"The Incredible Hulk,\" \"Captain America\" showcases the rise of Steve Rogers as the title character. Unlike the other films, which take place in modern times, this one goes way back to WWII, showing the Captain kicking Nazi butt! With a lot of \"Wolfenstein\" style occult mystique and a slight \"Indiana Jones\" sense of adventure, this movie has a number of solid action sequences, and plenty of imaginative special effects and setpieces. With its references to various characters and concepts of other Mavel movies, it fits into the franchise really well. It might take some stretch of the imagination to believe that Nazis could be this futuristic, but for a superhero movie, it's all good fun.\n\nThe story in this case is pretty solid. The main character shows strong development, and for most of the movie, you really root for him. There's nothing more thrilling than watching the underdog getting the upper hand. As it goes on, much of the character drama and story development gets pushed aside by the action, but it still works. By the end, voila, we have the lead-in for the \"Avengers\" film.\n\nIf there's any complaint for this film, it's that there could have been more. Whether it needs a stronger action setpiece or a more invoking sense of drama, I'm not sure, but something seems missing, and nothing really makes this film stand over any of the other superhero films that have come out so far.\n\nThe film is competently made, with decent (but never exceptional) photography. Editing is good for the most part, but I am not a fan of the montage in the middle of the film that makes the entire war campaign whiz by. A couple of action scenes seemed a little sloppily-edited, but it's hardly noticeable. Acting is swell; Chris Evans is surprisingly strong as the main character, and I enjoyed Hayley Atwell, Sebastian Stan, Tommy Lee Jones, Stanley Tucci, and Hugo Weaving in their roles. Writing seems pretty good. Production value is high, featuring lots of good (if not overly-slick) sets, props, costumes and special effects. Music is appropriately upbeat and adventurous. In the end, I'd say the film met my expectations, but never fully exceeded them. But it, along with an all-too-short sneak preview after the credits, provide the necessary bridge to the \"Avengers\" film.\n\nRecommended.\n\n4/5 (entertainment: 4/5, story: 4/5, film: 4/5)",

        "reviewText": "Yes, another high-production, superhero movie invades the theatres. Should you watch it?\n\nCaptain America: The First Avenger is an action-adventure movie that shows us the transformation of one Steve Rogers from a scrawny but patriotic man during World War II to Captain America, the star-spangled icon of freedom. Equipped with the Super-Soldier serum and his desire to do good, he finds the strength to combat Hydra, a Nazi offshoot, and its deranged leader, Johann Schmidt.\n\nTo a great extent, the First Avenger succeeds in translating the essence of its title character to the big screen. Captain America is portrayed as a humble guy who just wants to serve his country, so much so that he goes to great lengths to do it. Although there are minor changes to his comic book origin, who Captain America is is preserved. Steve Rogers may have said that he's \"just a kid from Brooklyn,\" but he is definitely so much more than that. He is the hero whom people look up to, and whom superheroes aspire to be. Captain America may not have the coolest powers but is relatable in so many levels.\n\nIt is becoming a trend in movies today to have a complicated plot in order to tell a good story. However, the First Avenger's approach, which centers on Captain America fighting the good fight, is pretty straightforward. The film proves that you don't need gazillion mind-boggling things to tell an inspiring tale of an extraordinary soldier on the frontlines. Being a superhero movie set in a war zone, it offers a healthy dose of action and involves Captain America bashing enemy heads and throwing his signature shield more times than you can count. Scenes of romance and humor help the film to become balanced and entertaining to watch. Steve is also a nice break from the morally conflicted heroes we usually encounter. He is simply someone who is moved to do what is right‚Äînothing more, nothing less.\n\nAside from the excellent character development and story progression, the film also boasts a solid cast. I honestly had doubts about Chris Evans playing the captain because he was such a fit for the cocky yet strong-willed Johnny Storm aka the Human Torch in the Fantastic Four movies, but he gives a convincing performance. Hugo Weaving as the menace Red Skull doesn't disappoint either, although we are still sure to remember him best as Agent Smith in the Matrix trilogy. Hayley Atwell's portrayal of Peggy Carter has a sense of both hardiness and elegance which makes the character easy to love. \n\nAs someone who consistently follows Captain America's exploits in comic books, my admiration for the character has increased even more because of the First Avenger. The film gives fans everywhere a good show. I especially liked that they were able to incorporate the printing of a Captain America comic book in a world where he really exists. The punching of \"Hitler\" in the face never gets old!\n\nDuring the course of Captain America: The First Avenger, viewers are shown how to be a patriot through Cap's positive demeanor and outlook. In the end, we come to realize that the film deals with fighting for the things we love ‚Äì freedom, country, friend and even one's own potential to do great things. The ending of the film may have been a bit abrupt, but it definitely points to a sequel. In this case, The Avengers (2012) is just around the corner, and it is something that we should watch if we want more of our Captain America.\n\nYes, another high-production, superhero movie invades the theatres. Should you watch it?\n\nOf course. There is no other option.",

        "reviewText": "\"Rocketeer\" director Joe Johnston's \"Captain America\" amounts to a timeless David versus Goliath tale set in the Marvel Comics' universe where good always trumps evil. Unlike \"Thor\" and \"Green Lantern,\" \"Captain America\" ranks as a thoroughly spectacular but larger-than-life extravaganza with a genuinely charismatic hero struggling against a marvelously malignant villain. Chris Evans' engaging performance as the 'First Avenger' is something else, too! If you recall, Evans had the time of his life several years ago playing egotistical Johnny Storm, aka 'the Human Torch,' in the two \"Fantastic Four\" flicks. Make no mistake; Evans is nothing like he was in those two super heroic sagas. Indeed, \"Captain America\" boasts some amazing special effects, but its best special effect is the sincerity that Evans brings to the role of Steve Rogers. Whether he plays Rogers as either a scrawny, 98-pound zero or a brawny, fleet-footed hero, Evans imparts heart to this $140-million thriller. During the first half of \"Captain America,\" Johnston gradually builds the momentum to let us grow accustomed to Evans as a scrappy little fellow who suffers the wrath of bullies. This pathetic weakling refuses to let anybody keep him down, and it's fun because Evans makes it look so authentic despite the obvious CGI effects. Hugo Weaving registers as the ideal villain who holds the upper hand throughout most of the supercharged shenanigans. Tommy Lee Jones and Hayley Atwell co-star respectively as Captain America's superior and his love interest.\n\n\"Captain America\" opens in the present before it reverts to the past. Typically, movies with contemporary openings and endings sacrifice any sense of suspense. After all, you know if the characters thrive in the present that they must not have suffered in the past. Basically, this constitutes nothing more than a narrative cinematic convention. The chief difference here is that we're only given a glimpse of Captain America's legendary star-spangled shield instead of the eponymous protagonist himself. Anyway, the film unfolds in the frozen wasteland of the Arctic Circle as a Russian oil expedition stumbles onto something buried in the ice. They contact the Americans who slice into the ice with a laser, find a commodious craft of unknown origin, and uncover a circular red, white, and blue shield with a star. The scene shifts to March 1942 as despicable Nazi officer Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving of \"The Matrix\") and his men storm into T√∏nsberg, Norway, and confiscate an enigmatic tesseract. Essentially, this is a magical cube boasting incalculable power. Supposedly, the tesseract was a fabulous jeweled artifact that belonged to the legendary Norse god Odin. Once anybody lays their eyes on it, they are no longer the same. Meanwhile, in New York City, the U.S. military brands Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) unfit for duty owing to a myriad of health problems. The resilient Rogers tries to enlist again when his buddy James Buchanan 'Bucky' Barnes (Sebastian Stan of \"Black Swan\") takes him to a showcase of futuristic technologies. Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci of \"Easy A\") eavesdrops on Rogers' conversation with Barnes about his desperate need to get into combat. Suitably impressed by Rogers' attitude, Erskine allows him to enlist. Moreover, Erskine recruits Rogers as part of a \"super-soldier\" experiment under the aegis of Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones of \"Coal Miner's Daughter\") and Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell of \"The Duchess\"). Phillips displays considerable skepticism about Erskine's contention that Rogers qualifies as the ideal candidate for the procedure. One day during a training exercise, Phillips lobs a grenade among the recruits. Everybody but Rogers scrambles for cover, while he smothers the grenade with his frail body. Predictably, the grenade is a dummy, but Rogers' act of self-sacrificing bravery convinces the colonel that he is the appropriate choice. \n\nNo sooner has Rogers emerged from the procedure as an entirely new man with a buffed up body than a Nazi saboteur steps in and kills Erskine. As it turns out, Erskine keep no notes except those in his head. After Erskine dies, Rogers experiences his new-found strength and captures the saboteur. The saboteur lives long enough to warn Rogers that he has to face more of his kind before he crunches on a cyanide capsule and croaks. Roger wins fame and acclaim across the country, but he suffers a setback because he is the first and only of his kind. Colonel Phillips reassigns him and Roger ends up at War Bond rallies where he acts like a cheerleader surrounded by dancing girls. Eventually, when our hero learns that his best friend has been caught, he disobeys orders and leads an inspirational rescue behind enemy lines. Now that Rogers has proved himself, he must face the Red Skull. The Red Skull is Nazi officer Johann Schmidt and he is so ambitious that he not only wants to crush America but also Adolf Hitler. Talk about a villain to end all villains! Anybody who has read the reprints of the World War 2 era \"Captain America\" comic book should be thrilled with the way that \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" scenarists Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have handled the original material by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby. Of course, Johnston and his scribes have ratcheted up the hardware for the big transformation scene that turns Steve Rodgers into Captain America. \n\nAltogether, \"Captain America\" is a predictable but entertaining comic book movie with sensational special effects and a sympathetic hero. If you are a Marvel Comic fan, you should stick around after the lengthy end credits for a glimpse of the forthcoming \"Avengers\" film due for release in May 2012.",

        "reviewText": "I loved this movie. Captain America has had 3 movies in the past, not counting some 1940s ones which can be excused for being good, that were so awful they make movies like Steel or Green Lantern look good. However, I saw a lot of critiques for this movie that were negative. Now I understand differing opinions and all, but they all followed a formula and each one seemed like griping to the point it was just getting stupid. If you'll indulge me here, I have a list of the repeated ones and a rebuttal to each.\n\n1. The technology for WWII is too far advanced! This one was the most common and the stupidest in my opinion. It's called \"Fiction\", as in \"not real\". Every time I heard this one it made me think these people have no suspension of disbelief and would complain that Iron Man is a terrible movie because the technology to build a flying robot suit doesn't exist yet. People, it's comic books and it's in a fictional WWII setting. It's allowed to take liberties.\n\n2. Captain America is too invincible! That was just stupid. Captain America is relatively weak compared to many other superheroes, he's just a perfect example of a human being brought about by the experiments in the film. Also, he's the main character. He's not supposed to die in a movie that is leading him up to be in a tie-in to all the other recent Marvel films that will lead to The Avengers.\n\n3. Red Skull is a terrible villain.\n\nThere is no sense to this one. He's supposed to be the guy that's worse than Hitler and can get just as many people on his side to do his bidding. On top of that he can take Cap in a fight fairly evenly. Saying he's a bad villain is baseless.\n\n4. Steve doesn't go through a character arc/get any back-story.\n\nFor one, he really doesn't need to. Steve was a good guy from the start, and he did go through an arc. It was subtle, but he did. He gained more confidence and become the soldier he is. He has a back-story but it's weaved in throughout. We know he was bullied a lot, we know he he is from a military family, we know he grew up with Bucky, we know he has had very few, if any, dates in his life, he's a childhood friend of Bucky, and we know he wants to be a soldier because he feels its his duty. I'd rather get it weaved in through the narrative of the story rather than get a huge text dump or just have characters talking for half an hour about everything they've ever done.\n\n5. This movie just glorifies America! Not really. It's a good vs. evil story that happens to have a character named Captain America, which was given to him by a publicity stunt. I suppose you also hate movies like Saving Private Ryan because it tells things from the perspective of American soldiers but not the Japanese ones? \n\nThese were the most common arguments and they are easily refutable. Captain America is a great movie, showcasing one of the best Marvel has to offer and should be in the 7s or higher, not the 6s.",

This is not because the character has any less depth than other super-heroes, but I knew that it would be extremely difficult to transition Steve Rogers to film in a serviceable way. The guy is called \"Captain America\" for heaven's sake.\n\nAny comic-book reader would probably appreciate the ironies and idiosyncrasies behind such ostentatiously patriotic code-name, mostly because in print Cap has challenged the assumptions behind his symbolism, becoming a more conflicted and universal figure.\n\nBut its hard to translate any of this idiosyncrasy successfully in 2 hours. Fortunately the film, instead of getting to political, is more old-fashioned pulp like Indy or \"Sky Captain,\" which thankfully never takes itself too seriously (which was one of the flaws of \"Thor\").\n\nI had my doubts that Chris Evans could pull off the modesty and heart needed for the role, but I was wrong. As the Red Skull, Hugo Weaving was wonderfully evil in a nostalgic, serial-villain kind of way. Haley Atwell is a sidekick/love-interest with the rare quality of not being incredibly annoying, and Tommy Lee Jones is perfectly cast as Tommy Lee Jones.\n\nThe reason I found this to be a good movie was because I enjoyed it, plain and simple. It's well-photographed and well-acted. Like its titular hero, it modestly embraced its silliness, creating a charming B-movie experience.",

        "reviewText": "The last of Marvel Comics' superheroes to make its big screen debut before next year's hotly anticipated 'The Avengers' was also the first to debut on print some 70 years ago in Joe Simon and Jack Kirby's Super Soldier series. Captain America was his name, his appearance at the time when the world was in the throes of World War II- though it would be months later before America finally decided to join in the fight following the bombing of Pearl Harbour.\n\nYou'd understand why then the character was created as a square-jawed, well-chiselled, honourable man with almost zero flaws- the world needed a hero in the truest sense of the word and Captain America fit that profile to a T. In adapting the comic character, writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (of the 'Narnia' franchise) have wisely opted not to distort the wholesome hero Captain America has been known to be, and this is precisely why their film stands out tall and strong against the plethora of superhero flicks in recent years.\n\nIndeed, moral ambiguity has become de rigueur for the modern-day superhero since the likes of 'The Dark Knight', so much so that the simplicity of old-fashioned true-blue heroism is in fact quite refreshing. And other than his physical build, Steve Rogers is no less than the perfect hero- his only wish is to enlist in the war to do his part for his nation, and he's not afraid to fight back even when faced with an opponent bigger and stronger than he is. Rogers is finally granted his wish- after numerous unsuccessful interviews- when he meets German defector Dr. Abraham Erskine (the excellent Stanley Tucci), who recruits him as part of the US Army's plan to create super-soldiers.\n\nNeedless to say, Rogers is eventually chosen among the candidates- the choice, as Dr Erskine explains to him, is because 'a strong man who has known power all his life may lose respect for that power; but a weak man knows the value of strength and knows compassion'. An agonising serum injection later, Rogers is transformed into the buff and muscular Captain America- his newfound powers quickly put to the test when he sets off down the streets of Manhattan barefoot in hot pursuit of a German spy who assassinates Dr Erskine just minutes after the experiment.\n\nThat spy is in fact under the service of renegade officer Johann Schmidt (The Matrix's Hugo Weaving in another expert villain role), the leader of the Nazis' occult research arm HYDRA building his own personal army for world domination. Schmidt is a fine nemesis to Captain America, the very antithesis of the latter's red-white-and-blue goodness and very definition of the word 'evil'. If the film draws Captain America as the equivalent of pure heroism, then so must it also paint Schmidt as the equivalent of complete evil.\n\nBut before the two go up against each other, Captain America must first overcome the politics of war, as he is quickly placed in a blue costume and made to perform on stage as an All-American hero to urge the public to buy war bonds and hence raise money for the war effort. Director Joe Johnston has plenty of satirical fun playing up the overt patriotism of these acts, presenting them in a montage that sees Captain America perform across different states but with the same act which includes a fake German Nazi. This detour into media celebrity also sees the film at its most grounded, as Captain America becomes a larger-than-life symbol used as a morale booster for the public.\n\nHe finally springs into action when he learns that his buddy Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) has been taken prisoner by HYDRA, and despite warnings from his former commanding officer, Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones), decides to go deep into enemy territory to rescue him and other prisoners-of-war. It is there he realises the extent of Schmidt's nefarious plans, the rest of the movie a non-stop thrill-ride as Captain America assembles his army to clean out Schmidt's bases one by one leading up to that final confrontation between the two.\n\nYes, it takes an hour before the action kicks in proper, but Johnston makes the wait absolutely worth it. Johnston has demonstrated his penchant for visual effects, and his abilities are plainly evident in the film's action set-pieces- beginning with a daring raid to rescue the POWs, followed by a sneak attack on Schmidt on board a moving train, and culminating in a climactic showdown set inside Schmidt's underground lair as well as around and in his fighter jet. There is unadulterated exhilaration to be had here, and the film's infectiously jaunty spirit adds immensely to the sheer enjoyment.\n\nOf course given the period setting, there is a need to bring our hero to the present to join with the other members of S.H.I.E.L.D. including their team leader Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson in yet another cameo)- but kudos to both the screen writing team of Markus and McFeely as well as director Johnston for keeping this adaptation true to the old pop culture motif that Captain America was. Whereas modern-day superheroes tend to be less clearly defined in terms of black and white or should we say good and evil, this old-school hero is a perfect nostalgic emblem of heroism. That and the fact that this movie is also mighty entertaining is just the perfect finish to this summer's superhero bombast, and a run-up par excellence to next summer's 'The Avengers'.\n\n\n* www.moviexclusive.com\n",

        "reviewText": "Hard to believe that just three years ago (2008), Marvel made the bold decision to create a single movie universe out of their second-tier heroes (though some may argue that Iron Man is first-tier; IMO, that honor really belongs to Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four...but that's an argument for another time) that would allow them to finally bring The Avengers to the big screen. This plan got off to a hugely successful start with 2008's IRON MAN (9/10) and a decent reboot of THE INCREDIBLE HULK (7/10) later that same year, and started picking up steam when 2010's IRON MAN 2 (8/10) brought War Machine and Black Widow into the picture. This year, THOR (7/10) ushered in a good start to the summer movie season and introduced the malevolently mischievous Loki to the mix while giving us a sneak peek at Hawkeye. Now, Captain America finally gets his chance to shine. How does he do?\n\nRejoice, Marvelites, for Marvel Studios has done it again...taken a hero whose origins would be difficult to get right on film and managed to make it look easy. Chris Evans, whose first foray into Marvel movies was playing Johnny Storm (the Human Torch) in the merely O.K. FANTASTIC FOUR, is amazing as Steve Rogers, the 90-lb. weakling who gets transformed into a Super Soldier and becomes the much-beloved Captain America. Evans never lets us forget that Cap's real strength has always been his good heart and his love for his country, and that overarching goodness and patriotism are perfectly blended together in this pastiche of 40's nostalgia mixed with WWII heroism and just a touch of steampunk (relax, it works here).\n\nThe plot, if you've read any reviews, you already know, so I won't rehash it here. Instead, I'll touch on how much I really enjoyed every moment in this movie; the scenes are perfectly put together, all the set pieces move the action forward (even the cheesy USO show montage), and the pace never drags, even in the slower, more personal sections. I do wish a little more work had gone into making the villainous Red Skull (the always-great Hugo Weaving, who could make reading a phonebook interesting) a more compelling villain to watch; yes, Weaving does great work with what he's been given, but he could have been so much better. HYDRA never really feels like a true threat because of the way Cap and his men handle them so easily, and that's too bad, because a real menacing presence is the one thing this movie really needed to go beyond \"Entertaining\".\n\nThe supporting players, though, all do great work in making this universe feel real and alive. Hayley Atwell as British Intelligence Agent Peggy Carter, Cap's budding love interest, is great, and their interactions are surprisingly touching. Dominic Cooper plays millionaire inventor Howard Stark with a mixture of charm and intensity (and more than a little touch of Robert Downey Jr.'s mannerisms--watch for the moment when Stark peers over the top of his glasses in a very Downey-esque manner) that provides a nice foreshadowing of his importance in later Marvel lore (as a founder of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the father of Iron Man Tony Stark)--plus seeing an early version of Stark Industries' logo on every piece of tech is too cool for words. Tommy Lee Jones was born to play an Army hard-nose, and he doesn't disappoint as Rogers' commanding officer Colonel Chester Phillips.\n\nThe movie, though, ultimately hinges on Evans' ability to pull off the earnestly intense Captain America, and he does it brilliantly. Even the moment where Cap makes what he believes will be the Ultimate Sacrifice (and if you know your Captain America lore, you know EXACTLY what that sacrifice is and how he's going to do it) never becomes cheesy or overdone; when Cap's voice vanishes from the radio, I cried. Stick around for the post-credits tease, where we FINALLY get our first look at THE AVENGERS (due in 2012); it's well worth it.,",

And being fond of the adventure genre, I anticipate movies like the Indiana Jones trilogy, \"The Rocketeer\", \"Sky Captain And the World of Tomorrow\", \"The Mummy\" (1999) and, of course, \"Captain America\".\n\nWhen I first heard about this movie, my expectations soared. The director was Joe Johnston, who made my favorite superhero movie, \"The Rocketeer\". It was set during WWII, made in a 1940s style, and scored by Alan Silvestri. Alas, my heart sank after I found out that they were going to do the whole frozen alive storyline I've always hated. But, I reasoned, the only reason they are making it is because of \"The Avengers\". Without that storyline, they wouldn't even be making it. Beggars can't be choosers.\n\nWell, after two years of waiting, I got to see the movie. And to my surprise, it surpassed my high expectations. I didn't even hate the ending, although I would have much preferred a happier one more in line with the original 1940s comics (in which Cap stays in his own era, then fights commies in the 1950s). So, here are my thoughts on the movie.\n\nActing.\n\nChris Evans was great as Captain America. He nailed the character. After watching him as Captain America, I can't see anyone else in the role. The special effects performed on him to make him look skinny for the first part of the movie were absolutely seamless. If I hadn't known about them, I wouldn't have been able to tell they were there. But those effects would not have looked nearly so great if it had not been for Evans convincingly \"acting skinny\". No matter what condition Steve Rogers is in, shrimp or super soldier, Chris Evans portrayed him flawlessly.\n\nIt was refreshing to see a non-angsty, pure-hearted hero for the first time in a while. Instead of portraying Cap with irony or satire, they took him seriously, and it really payed off. Cap, despite (or because of) his delightful simplicity and earnestness, comes across as incredibly deep and human, proving once again that the notion of the old-fashioned hero being inferior to his modern antihero counterpart is merely a haughty assumption.\n\nHugo Weaving's Red Skull was effectively menacing, darkly humorous, and overall deliciously like an old-fashioned serial villain. Haley Atwell was charming, feisty and classically beautiful as Peggy Carter. Stanley Tucci's Dr. Erskine was played to perfection, Tommy Lee Jones was a scene-stealer of the highest order, Toby Jones was very memorable as a sympathetic, almost lovable Arnim Zola, Richard Armitage was effectively despicable, Dominic Cooper was good as Howard Stark, and Neal McDonough made his presence known despite very little screen time. Sebastion Stan was also quite good as Bucky, although he wasn't quite as memorable as many of the others.\n\nVisuals and Action.\n\nMy feelings on the visuals are mixed. I was hoping for a bit more of a photo-realistic feel, but it instead looks a bit too much like \"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\" (a movie whose visuals I like very much, but would prefer to be a novelty, not the norm). That said, the use of wide lenses did help make it look more real than many other movies with such massive amounts of CGI. The color in many scenes is quite good, or at least by today's standards. I did dislike the muted color used in some of the winter scenes, though. I wish they had gone for more of a Technicolor look, but I'm pretty satisfied with the look of the movie, except for the winter scenes.\n\nI didn't like the action montage too much, as it had some slow-motion effects, as well as giving off a feeling that you're being cheated out of some scenes. I also thought that the motorcycle-chase felt somewhat rushed. Other than that, however, I did like most of the action scenes. The Kruger chase, Cap's first mission, and the final fight with Red Skull were standouts.\n\nI would have preferred that the HYDRA soldiers' uniforms look a bit more Nazi-like, but the look they have works well. Red Skull doesn't care about them as individuals. He is the Hydra, and they are merely his many identical heads. Thus, their faceless, almost robotic look works very well. \n\nMusic.\n\nSilvestri's score is the best superhero score in years. His main theme unfortunately doesn't have the \"flow\" that some of his better works do, and seems a little clunky at first. But after you hear it a few times, it grows on you. It's now stuck in my head. Overall, Silvestri's score hits all the right notes, and captures menace, adventure, and every other mood required of it, while having actual themes. Media Ventures, eat your collective heart out.\n\nWriting.\n\nThe humor was great throughout. The levels of \"heart\" were set to maximum. The romance, although sparse, was memorable. Everything was portrayed swiftly, without padding, The plot was very well thought out. Memorable lines and scenes abound. Overall, the writing was excellent. Some things that I particularly liked were Steve's journey from shrimp to super-soldier, the USO scene, Cap's first mission, the role-reversal with Bucky, and the romance. I also liked how Red Skull was his own boss. It gave him more menace. Plus, using HYDRA ironically makes it feel more historically accurate. Having Captain America defeat the Nazis would mess with history too much, and having him lose to them just wouldn't do. All I really disliked were Bucky's death and Captain America getting frozen alive. That could work well in some movies, but a 1940s-style adventure of this sort just cries out for a happy ending. Plus, the modern-day bookends detract from the overall atmosphere. Still, the final scenes were poignant, although out-of-place.\n\n9/10.",

And, if not the best, it is as good as the best. In fact, my only real reservation derives from the fact that Captain America has never been a character which does very much for me (and, even after the movie, which I enjoyed immensely, he still doesn't).\n\nThe story is familiar to comic fans - weedy Steve Rogers is transformed by a super serum into enhanced Captain America, who pursues super-Nazi the Red Skull.\n\nI very much liked the period setting, which gave this film a feel which is quite different to the other super-hero movies (even the 60s-based X-Men: First Class felt fairly contemporary), and all the principals gave excellent performances.. The action and effects all worked well (particularly the transformation of Chris Evans into the scrawny pre-serum Steve Rogers), and I suspect that there were lots of nice touches which meant a lot to those more familiar with the comics mythology of Cap than I am (I got a flavour from time to time that others might know who so-and-so was, but I didn't).\n\nAs well as the big picture, there were lots of small touches I liked - the early incarnations of the shield, the use of the first comics costume, the establishment of Steve Rogers as a bona fide hero even when he was a skinny weed, for instance. But the thing I liked most about this film (and, to some extent, it contrasts with many other super-hero movies) is the fact that much of what happened in this film really mattered, both on a big scale and also on a more intimate level. Joe Johnston did a very good job in making every element of this film work together.\n\nI am looking forward to seeing the The Avengers next year, and I hope Joss Whedon does as good a job as Johnston.",

So I'm one of the people who could sit back and enjoy the movie for what it was rather than nitpick on gaps in the CA lore.\n\nThe best thing about the movie is what's not in it- and that's cheap advertising gimmicks, such as a character opening a laptop to show an Apple or Sony logo, or car symbols or Coke, Pepsi or any fast food restaurant. It, however, would have been interesting to see if they could tie CA into their food products by having Marvel burgers or the American Superburger...I dislike cheap advertising tricks and thankfully this was completely avoided. Gone also was any chance of using high tech gadgets much like what was shown in Iron Man 2.\n\nI found the plot interesting- the buildup to Steve Rogers becoming Captain American was done well and very interesting. The downside would be the action sequences which I thought would be more realistic or appropriate to the time setting. Instead several sequences were more reminiscent of what Iron Man 2 felt like.\n\nAs I'm not a CA follower some of the historical nods to certain symbols or the side characters themselves were lost to me but I did enjoy that Howard Stark's character was in the movie as it introduced the origin of Stark Industries and it's technologies of the future.\n\nActingwise Chris Evans did a surprisingly good job. In Fantastic Four he was OTT and hammed a lot and was generally quite annoying. Here he's more serious, focused and determined. There were a lot less quips, something I really detest in American made super hero movies. The cheesy quips might work in graphic novels or comics but in movies it comes off as plain lame. Hugo Weaving was quite good though too- he's becoming quite popular in characters taken from literature, comics or cartoons.\n\nThis is a movie for pretty much every age gap. There are no swear words (I don't even think the word damn makes it into the movie!) and no sex scenes so kids are perfectly fine to watch it. It's definitely the best superhero movie of the year and one of the better ones made entirely. I doubt that any sequel will be as good in terms of plot and story setting but in the meantime enjoy this summer gem.",

        "reviewText": "I'm not fan of Iron Man, but really enjoyed the movie Thor, so I wasn't sure what I'd make of this movie. After the opening scene (which made me wonder if I was watching the wrong film), we cut to the 1940s during WW2. It's this change of scenery/time period that gives the film a different sort of tone/flavor, thus making it stand out from the crowd. It's like a good old-fashioned action adventure movie (which should be no surprise given it's from Joe Johnston, who directed The Rocketeer).\n\nAnother large part of what makes this film successful is its cast. To any who doubted Chris Evans, he more than proves himself as Steve Rogers. Thanks to impressive computer-aided trickery, we meet Steve as a scrawny \"90 pound asthmatic\", who has a never-give-up attitude, but sadly nobody takes seriously when he wants to help fight the war. After befriending a kind scientist, Steve gets to be the first test subject in a planned long line of super soldiers. His transformation into the epitome of physical perfection is quite the sight to behold, as we see Scrawny Evans turned into Steamy Evans, who's a muscle-bound man with enhanced abilities and doesn't have a robotic suit doing all the work for him. What's important to note, though, is that what makes Steve a hero isn't the abilities he gains, but who he was *before* the transformation. It's just that now he's finally allowed to be the best that he truly can be in physicality to match his hero's heart.\n\nI really appreciated that he wasn't yet another wise-cracking smart-ar$e, as a lot of 'heroes' seem to be nowadays, which makes him easily likable, and it's this endearing quality which catches the eye of Agent Peggy Carter, played by the stunning Hayley Atwell, who I have no problem saying is officially my hero. Peggy is the perfect woman, as she's got it all (brains, beauty and bada$$edness). Atwell plays her to perfection and Peggy is easily my favourite female lead in a comic book movie. There's a sweet relationship between Peggy and Steve that develops throughout the film and it's clear that she admires/cares for him not because of the way he (now) looks, but because of who he *is* as a person, his intelligence and selflessness. Evans and Atwell have excellent chemistry/play well off each other and are my favourite comic book movie couple.\n\nOther characters in the film include Tommy Lee Jones, as the gruff Colonel Phillips, who's a bit rough around the edges, but manages to show that he's not entirely without heart. Stanley Tucci is excellent as the doctor who sees the potential in Steve others don't. A real friendship develops between the two, and it goes a long way to making sure that when Dr. Erskine exits the film, we feel what Steve feels. This isn't the only important/meaningful friendship in the film, though. Sebastian Stan plays another likable character as Steve's best friend, Bucky, Their dynamic feels very real/believable, as Bucky is one of the few to stand up for Steve.\n\nLastly, Hugo Weaving does some major scenery-chewing in the role of Johann Schmidt. Not everything goes according to plan for the crazy Nazi dude obsessed with becoming a god (when will these bad guys in comic book films learn NOT to experiment on themselves?), and he winds up becoming a disfigured red-skulled villain. I actually liked how the reveal of Red Skull was approached, with only very vague hints to what was lurking underneath the surface early in the film (like when he's standing in shadow, posing for his portrait, with copious amounts of red paint having been used to indicate something's not right). Once we do finally see him in his full Red Skull glory, this is when Weaving seems to really cut loose with the role and we're treated to a memorable montage. He's supported by Toby Jones as Dr. Arnim Zola, the 'Smithers' to Weaving's 'Mr. Burns' (there's even a sequence where Red Skull has an escape ship and Zola's wondering where he's going to sit, to which Red Skull basically replies that he likes to put his feet up. Okay, not exactly the same as that, but I noticed the similarity).\n\nThe film has several standout action sequences that are imaginative and offer us something different to your typical explosions/gunfire, though one scene that I particularly enjoyed wasn't action-based at all. Before Captain America's even gotten a proper costume, he's stuck in tights with little wings jutting out from the sides of his cowl (all those who complained about the updated Captain America costume need only see this nod to the original version to realise that changes did indeed need to be made), but what makes this scene so memorable is the fact that we're treated to a performance of the supremely catchy 'Star-Spangled Man' whilst Captain America travels around the country to boost morale, promoting war bonds. It's a delightful surprise/stand-out sequence in the movie.\n\nThankfully, Cap eventually gets upgraded to much more practical star-spangled duds (which I saw described as resembling 'a tricked-out airman's jumpsuit, complete with a mask which looks to be adapted from a WW2 helmet' and he also acquires a handy shield which doubles as a kick-ar$e Frisbee, which he performs some impressive shield-fu with. The only slight negative I found with this film was the ending, which stinks of being merely set-up for The Avengers (of which there is yet more set up for, plus a teaser trailer of, at the end of the film's credits) instead of the film feeling like it gets its own proper satisfying ending (much like Thor did). Sadly, the blossoming relationship between Steve & Peggy is cruelly cut short (their goodbye scene is emotional/very effective). Aside from the opening and closing scenes, I enjoyed this film immensely and found it to be a rollicking good time with a lot of heart to it, thus making it my favourite MCU film.",

        "reviewText": "As just a kid from Brooklyn, Captain America makes a name for himself in this extremely entertaining and engaging superhero flick. Like Superman, Captain America is Marvel Comics answer to the Red, White, and Blue, and while this movie could have been a simple set up to Marvel's The Avengers, it manages to be its own movie. Part of this is because it takes place first in the timeline of all of the Marvel Studios' movies, so there are fewer references to the other heroes who come later down the line, but this movie also focuses on showing the transformation of Steve Rogers, from scrawny kid getting beat up in the alleys of Brooklyn, to the symbol of hope for America in World War II.\n\nThe movie is almost entirely set in the 1940s, featuring the Greatest Generation in all of its glory, with this movie somewhat playing as a love letter to that simpler time where evil was evil, and good was good. When a small fry guy named Steve Rogers gets rejected five different times to be enlisted in the Army, he gets a lucky shot from a military scientist, Dr. Erskine, who tests an experimental super soldier formula on Rogers, and voila! We now have a superhero. But it takes more than muscles to be a true hero, and even though Rogers managed to impress Erskine with his compassion, fortitude, and morals, he must do the same for the big guns at the military if he wants to see actual action aside from being a part of song and dance numbers and movie serials to sell war bonds.\n\nDirector Joe Johnston plays around with the 1940s setting, with the whole movie filmed in sepia tones evoking the look of the pop culture from the period. The story plays like one long Saturday matin√©e serial, filled with tons of pulp and improbable science fiction, but those were stalwarts of the adventure stories of the time. What Johnston does best though, is mastering Rogers' journey from zero to hero. As Captain America, Steve Rogers uses his compassion, fortitude, and morals, to do near impossible missions, as is seen in a scene where Rogers saves over 400 prisoners of war all on his own, proving to the Army that he should be on the front line of the war effort and not helping with morale back home. Throughout the whole movie, Rogers bonds with an American agent named Peggy Carter, winning her heart through the same inner heroism that made him Captain America. Carter is a pin up girl in looks, but a girl who can show up the boys in attitude. Add on to this all, a great maniacal villain in Red Skull (played by Hugo Weaving in some of the greatest make up work in a while), and you have a solid adventure yarn.\n\nWhile the final scene left me scratching my head a bit, feeling tacked on, and the scene before giving the real closure to the story, I think Marvel was trying to pump up The Avengers even more, so I get it, though it still deterred from an otherwise emotional ending. Even with this small bump in the road, it's really the only blemish in this extremely well made and polished superhero flick that doesn't reinvent the wheel, but neither breaks it. Solid, entertaining, and heroic, everything a good superhero movie should be, which is exactly what this movie is.\n\nI give Captain America: The First Avenger a 9 out of 10!",

Added to that Fox's reboot of X-Men was able to get that series right after the mess Brett Ratner left it in.\n\nSteve Rogers (Chris Evans) is a small, skinny man with a number of health problems who wants to fight in the American Army in 1942. After numerous times of trying to enlist a German scientist, Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) sees his determination and good heart is able to pull some strings and gets him into the army. Rogers joins a special unit and is seen as the perfect candidate to become America's first super soldier, giving him enhanced strength, speed and healing abilities. In Germany the Nazi's secret science division, HYDRA and its leader Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving) discovers a blue cube of energy and believes it could give him the power of the Gods and likes all mad scientists plans to take over the world. In America Rogers is made into a performing act, encouraging the public to buy war bonds and given the name Captain America. But Rogers wants to fight in the war and is given his chance to take on HYDRA in 1943.\n\nI personally preferred Thor over Captain America, but it still a fun summer flick and a solid 7.5/10. Captain America has plenty of references to Thor and the Iron Man films and shows how these franchise should be interlinked. Captain America is able to mix a light touch but making sure it treats the source material with respect and keeps it serious. Joe Johnston wouldn't have been my first choice to direct this film but certainly made it fun and he was more assured as an action director compared to Kenneth Brangh, director of Thor. It was a fast paced actioneer, but Johnston made sure they was enough time to let us know the characters and the set up for the plot. When Captain America first gains his powers the scene of him catching an assassin on top of a taxi reminded me a lot of the first Spider-man film, a film that got mix of serious and light-hearted right. This was certainly a good introduction to character and the start for what should be another successful adaptation for Marvel.\n\nThe humour throughout the film is deadpan and there are very good performance from the supporting cast, especially Weaving, Tommy Lee Jones and Tucci. Weaving certainly knows how to portray evil characters. Evans was able to instill Captain America's values of determination, freedom, strength and being a force for good. But the thing about Captain America is that he is a classic hero, living in a world of absolutes of good and evil, they is no ambiguity. And well, Hayley Atwell is a token Brit so she gets a free pass.\n\nThe score by Alan Silverstri it self has an old fashion, grand feel to it and there were reminds to films such as the first Hellboy film, starting during World War Two with the Nazis using mythology to gain an advantage to win the war and classic 60s and 70s war films like Where Eagles Dare.\n\nCaptain America is an enjoyable blockbuster and necessary viewing if you plan to view The Avengers in 2012.",

And this combination of humor and charm continues even as the tale becomes full of the revenge motif once our hero embarks on his more dangerous course as the man who must fight his nemesis, The Red Skull, rescuing the world as well as his good buddy from enemy hands. CHRIS EVANS is highly capable of making us believe in his \"Captain America,\" before and after the transformation.\n\nAs summer blockbusters go, \"Captain America\" ranks with one of the best. Within the scope of little more than two hours it sets up the Marvel comic with a flair and style worthy of more important material, succeeding in recreating the WWII era (from a World's Fair with art deco touches to the USO entertainments), with costumes, sets and characters all firmly set in traditional 1940s style.\n\nAnd the cast is up to bringing all this material to life. HUGO WEAVER has a fine time as the crazed mastermind out to ruthlessly destroy his enemies. He's a sort of Conrad Veidt villain on steroids. TOMMY LEE JONES as a gruff colonel with a heart of gold, HAYLEY ATWELL as a pretty soldier who knows how to throw a punch, and SEBASTIAN STAN as our hero's best buddy--all of them shine in colorful supporting roles. DOMINIC COOPER as Howard Stark and STANLEY TUCCI as Dr. Erskine bring additional humor and grace to their parts.\n\nJoe Johnston's direction gives the light touch where needed (especially during the USO shows where Captain America is being used as a poster boy before the troops), but never falters during the explosive action scenes.\n\nLikewise, Alan Silvestri's jaunty score never fails to support the on screen antics with some flag-waving patriotism suitable for the movie's thematics, and assures the viewer from the start that all he has to do is sit back and enjoy a well-delivered popcorn package of thrills and laughs.\n\nRecommended for all Marvel fans.",

Up until last month, Iron Man was the best movie to capture the main idea of the character and story, in my opinion. Iron Man was a very true to the mythos and great to watch. Captain America is better and that is not taking anything away from Iron Man. Yes, still some aspects of the story was changed, but I felt this was a great translation that captured and added to Captain America. They handled the background story and cast of characters with intelligence. I think the original intent of Captain America's creator comes through and what his values were. They did a great job with Steve Rogers pre-super soldier serum with the visual effects. The plot was very good and moved along well developing the story.

Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving), a high-ranking Nazi and leader of the HYDRA sect, nonchalantly enters. He crosses the room, comes to the difficult-to-open sarcophagus and easily pushes the lid free. Within he finds the skeletal remains of an old Viking clutching a glass cube (the Tesseract). The caretaker pleads for Schmidt to leave it. Schmidt scoffs and tells how this cube would be the jewel of Odin's treasury if it weren't a fake. He smashes it on the floor and goes to the caretaker, asking where the real cube is hidden. The caretaker initially refuses but under threat of harm to his family, he relents, gesturing to a hidden drawer across the room, part of an ancient carving the size of the wall. Schmidt pries the drawer open and finds the real, glowing cube concealed within. Schmidt orders his men to shell the city and then shoots the luckless caretaker.\n\nAt a recruiting station in Brooklyn, Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), a 20-something, 90 lb, 5-foot tall asthmatic eagerly awaits the opportunity to enlist in the United States Army. The army doctor gives a once-over to Steve's medical file, which reads like that of a 90 year old man, and rejects Steve's application as the military 4-F, as this is his fourth failed attempt to enlist.\n\nDistraught, Steve heads to the movies. He envies the enlisted men featured in the pre-show newsreel, and watches as other audience members tear up. A loud-mouthed, impatient movie-goer begins yelling at the screen \"Start the movie! I didn't pay to see this crap!\" Steve tells the man to shut up, and is surprised as the man turns around, stands up and towers above him. In the alley behind the theater the bully savagely beats the scrawny Steve, who bravely fights back, but is easily overpowered. When his opponent asks him why he won't simply give up, the bloodied Steve says \"I can do this all day.\" James \"Bucky\" Barnes (Sebastian Stan), Steve's best friend, comes running to the alley. He swiftly kicks the bully away and tends to Steve, who is annoyed that Bucky showed up and got rid of the bully just as Steve got his second wind. \"Bucky\" is now an enlisted-man. His application was accepted and he's been assigned to the 107th infantry.\n\nIn a celebratory mood, Bucky invites Steve to go dancing with a pair of girls on a double date. Bashfully, Steve tags along. The four head to the World's Fair in Queens. While Bucky canoodles with his dates, Steve watches as playboy inventor Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper) unsuccessfully demonstrates a flying car. Steve breaks away from the group and goes to another recruiting station. Bucky catches up with him and asks how Steve intends to forge his application this time. Unbeknownst to them both, Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) while passing by, eavesdrops on their conversation. He is fascinated by the gumption of Steve. Bucky wishes Steve good luck on his latest application and Steve heads in to the recruiting station for his fifth physical. Inside Steve sits on an examination table and grows nervous when an MP enters the room, and is soon followed by Dr. Erskine. Dr. Erskine has all of Steve's prior applications on file. Concerned by Steve's failed applications, Erskine tests his character by asking if his insistence on applying for military service is driven purely by a desire to kill Nazis. The young man sincerely reveals that he is not a killer at heart, but does not like \"bullies\" regardless of their origin; he also shows little concern when Erksine reveals that he is German by birth. Won over by Steve's strong will and unwavering conviction, Erksine accepts his latest application.\n\nIn a secret military installation high in the Alps, Johann Schmidt brings the glowing cube to Dr. Arnim Zola, his Hydra weapon specialist. The cube's seemingly limitless power enables Schmidt and Dr. Zola to power unstoppable energy guns and cannons.\n\nMeanwhile, Steve has been enlisted into basic training under the careful watch of Dr. Erskine and Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones). He and his platoon are told that they are candidates for the government's latest Super Soldier program. Phillips is unimpressed with Steve and is vexed by Dr. Erskine's interest in him. During basic training Steve meets a beautiful but driven British officer, Peggy Carter (Haley Atwell), who seems to pity him. Despite being the smallest and weakest of the platoon, Steve demonstrates the greatest spirit, selflessness and ingenuity, especially when his platoon are charged with retrieving a flag from the top of a tall pole: as the other, more fit men in the company fail the task one by one as they try to climb up the pole, Steve casually pulls the pin holding it up, taking the flag when the pole crashes to the ground. Phillips, still unconvinced, tosses a grenade into the group during calisthenics and they all scatter. Phillips is surprised when Steve alone leaps on top of it, willing to sacrifice himself to save the others, before discovering that the grenade was a dummy. Phillips concedes to Erskine's decision.\n\nThat evening, Dr. Erskine speaks with Steve. The two bond over a bottle of Schnapps and Dr. Erskine reveals that this is not his first time performing this experiment. He tells a story of how, prior to his emigration to the US, he was ordered by Johann Schmidt to create a serum that would give a man god-like strength. Dr. Erskine created an early version of the serum he intends to use on Steve, only when Schmidt injected himself his body's skin corroded away, leaving him as a sinewy red skeleton. Undeterred by the risk, Steve agrees to follow through with the procedure.\n\nThe following morning Steve and Peggy wind their way through Brooklyn and come to a stop in front of an old antique shop. Along the way Steve points out various parts in Brooklyn where he's been beaten up. She asks him why he never ran away. He responds that running away, in his mind, was an invitation for further abuse.\n\nThe two enter the antique shop, exchange pass-codes with an old woman manning the register, and descend into a secret military bunker concealed within. Peggy leads Steve to the heart of the bunker where they find Dr. Erskine preparing a medical capsule along with Howard Stark, and Colonel Phillips rubbing elbows with senators and dignitaries. Steve is told to remove his shirt and sit in the capsule. Stark describes that the procedure will first mean injecting muscle re-generators into Rogers' major muscle groups which will then be bombarded with \"vita rays.\" Erskine has made no secret of the pain Steve will endure but promises he'll come out stronger. Carter bids Steve good luck and joins Phillips in the overhead viewing chamber. Erskine's serum is injected into Steve's muscles and Steve is enclosed within the vita ray capsule. The capsule glows brightly, Steve yells in pain but also tells them to continue and the procedure is quickly completed. When the capsule is shut down, Steve comes out a foot taller and a hundred pounds heavier with solid muscle, which is just the most superficial aspects of his body artificially raised to the maximum human potential.\n\nEverybody, including Phillips, celebrates the success of the procedure, and descends from the viewing chamber to congratulate Erskine. A lone dignitary, in actuality a German spy named Heinz Kruger (Richard Armitage), stays behind, placing a small satchel on a chair. Moments later the viewing gallery explodes. Kruger descends the stairs and fatally shoots Dr. Erskine twice. He swiftly kills the guards and flees onto the streets with Peggy in hot pursuit. Steve tends to a dying Dr. Erskine, who has just enough energy to point to Steve's heart before he dies. Steve bolts out of the bunker, in pursuit of Kruger.\n\nIn the street Peggy pursues Kruger, and easily kills his getaway driver. Kruger steals a taxi and aims to run over Peggy. Steve arrives in the nick of time, saving her from being killed by the on-coming taxi. Steve pursues the taxi on foot, running faster than a normal human can (and not suffering the fatigue even a healthy man would). Displaying superhuman agility, he leaps onto the roof of the taxi, dodges Kruger's gunfire and the two come to a crashing stop at the Brooklyn docks. Kruger shoots at Steve, who holds the star-imprinted door of the wrecked cab in front of him as a shield. Kruger flees to his Hydra sub, which dives underwater just as Steve arrives. Steve dives after the sub, punches a hole through the cockpit's glass and yanks Kruger to the surface. Kruger tells Steve that he is the first of many, that Rogers can \"cut off one head,\" but two more take it's place.\" He then kills himself with a cyanide capsule hidden in a fake tooth, letting out one last \"Heil HYDRA!\" before dying.\n\nMeanwhile, Schmidt and Dr. Zola are visited by a trio of Hitler's top commanders, tasked with inspecting Schmidt's operation. They ridicule Schmidt, saying that the Nazi party no longer takes him and HYDRA seriously due to his obsession with magic and the occult and playfully refer to him as \"The Red Skull\", a name that infuriates Schmidt. Schmidt takes the three to his weapons lab where they are shown his unstoppable energy weapons and a strategic map of Europe dotted with targets. One of the three notices a target hovering over Berlin and confronts Schmidt. Schmidt quickly vaporizes the three Nazi officers. Schmidt announces that HYDRA has disbanded from the Nazi party and is now enemies with the world.\n\nThe following day Phillips and Carter pick up the remains of Dr. Erskine's lab. Both are despondent because the only person capable of producing the serum was Erskine himself. Steve is eager to go the front lines of the European Theatre but Phillips would rather he be a lab-rat than a soldier in his army. Steve is approached by a senator holding a newspaper of the prior day's events, emblazoned with a front-page photo of Steve chasing down Heinz Kruger. Steve has become an overnight celebrity and the Senator has an idea that will be mutually beneficial.\n\nSteve is enlisted in the USO (United Service Organizations), and travels around the Midwest, promoting war bonds and performing musical numbers in a shoddy red, white and blue costume while carrying a triangle-shaped shield bearing the stars-and-stripes. He takes on the name \"Captain America\" and the show includes a theme song written specifically for him, features dancing girls and a short segment where he punches out Hitler, played by an actor. Captain America becomes an overnight success, spawning comic books and black and white movies. His antics drum up revenue for the USO.\n\nSteve is soon taken overseas, to Italy, where he is to continue entertaining the troops. Upon his arrival the surly and war-torn men tease him and tell him to get lost. He is soon met by Carter, who along with Phillips, is overseeing European Theatre of the war. She tells him that the men are unhappy because many men from their division, the 107th Infantry, have been killed in battle. Steve realizes that this is Bucky's division, and quickly runs to see Phillips. Phillips is unable to find Bucky's name on his casualty list and tells Steve to go back to his job as a movie star and a cheerleader. Steve asks Carter where the men, and Bucky, are being held. She shows him a map, and a known HYDRA weapons factory 30-40 miles behind enemy lines. Steve hastily pulls on a pair of army trousers and leather jacket over his Captain America costume, and a blue helmet with a white 'A' stamped on the front. He aims to steal a jeep and drive into HYDRA's back yard, but she has a better idea.\n\nHoward Stark flies them both over the battlefield in his private plane. Steve surmises that Stark and Carter have a relationship and bashfully withholds his feelings for her. Just as anti-aircraft guns from HYDRA begin firing on Stark's plane, Steve parachutes in, while the other two escape back to safety. Steve stealthily makes his way into the HYDRA base, taking out numerous guards in the process.\n\nInside, Schmidt and Zola are manufacturing enough weapons to wipe out every capital in the world. Steve makes his way to the holding cells where he sees hundreds of imprisoned men from the 107th. He frees the men and tells them to make a \"messy\" exit. Under the leadership of the \"Howling Commandos\" the prisoners manage to overpower their captors, steal guns and tanks, and escape from the facility, destroying much of it. Schmidt watches Steve by CCTV, and quickly realizes that he must be Erskine's man. He quickly activates several explosive charges that will level the base.\n\nSteve makes his way through the facility and happens across Bucky, who is tied down to an operating table, and has quite obviously been tortured. Steve also notices an oversized tactical map mounted on the wall, with various marked installations. Steve frees Bucky, who is surprised to see that Steve is taller than him, and commits the map to memory.\n\nThe two head up the catwalks and find themselves face to face with Schmidt on a retractable bridge. Rogers punches Schmidt, who surprisingly stands his ground. Schmidt plays with his face, which has apparently come free from his skull, and quickly peels it away as a mask. The Red Skull stares back at Rogers and Bucky and swiftly enters an elevator. In the elevator The Red Skull tells Arnim Zola to meet him at another one of Hydra's bases and to take his car. The Red Skull escapes the exploding facility in a strangely-designed private plane while Zola sneaks away in Schmidt's roadster. Inside Steve and Bucky have a huge divide to cross to their freedom. Bucky crosses a trembling, buckling support beam and manages to cross to safety moments before the beam plummets into the fire below. Left with no other option, Steve backs up as far as he can and leaps over the burning chasm.\n\nBack at the 107th base camp, Phillips dictates a letter to his typist, telling how Rogers disappeared the prior night and likely perished during the battle. At that, Phillips berates Agent Carter for causing this loss and notes that unlike the indispensable Stark, she herself can be punished. Carter attempts to justify her actions, but Phillips bluntly dismisses her opinions considering that the loss of Rogers, the only successful test subject of Project: Rebirth, would be ample justification to close down their organization. Just then, Rogers arrives, with nearly 400 survivors of the 107th carrying samples of the Red Skull's technology including some combat vehicles leaving the base in a fervor. Rogers submits himself to Phillips for disciplinary action for going out in direct violation of orders, but is forgiven. At this success, Bucky calls for cheers for Rogers, who has truly become Captain America.\n\nThe news of \"Captain America's\" success on the battlefield has swept over the world, but Rogers does not appear for his medal from Congress. The reason for that absence is in London, where Steve gives Phillips and Carter his best recollection of the HYDRA base map and tells them that he intends to go to those bases and destroy them one by one, and wishes to recruit a team of men made up of those he liberated in Italy. Steve meets the Howling Commandos in a bar and they eagerly accept the offer. While there all the men are surprised as Peggy enters dressed in a form-fitting cocktail dress. She ignores all the men, including Bucky, and flirts with Steve, telling him that she'd love to have a dance with him some day.\n\nThe next day Steve is summoned to the Brooklyn bunker to see Phillips and Stark. Steve is approached by a beautiful female officer who wishes to thank him for his service the best way she knows how. Peggy walks in on Steve kissing the enlisted-woman and angrily storms away. Steve apologetically follows her to Stark's lab, insisting that he gets nervous around women and asks why he should apologize if Carter and Stark have a thing going. Stark quickly shoots down the rumored relationship and takes Steve to his weapons engineering lab. He remarks that Rogers has become attached to the triangular shield, which Steve says is a handy tool in the field. On a table are several prototype shields with sophisticated components, however Steve finds a plain, circular shield on a lower shelf. Stark explains that the shield is made of a metal called \"vibranium\", which is lighter than steel and is vibration resistant and will absorb heavy impacts. He holds the shield in front of him and asks Peggy for his opinion. She playfully/scornfully fires a clip from a .45 pistol at the shield, which Steve ducks behind. The shield passes the improvised test admirably. As she walks off, Steve passes a sketch of a uniform to Stark.\n\nSteve dresses in red, white and blue fatigues, dons a blue form-fitting helmet and stows the newly-colored shield onto his back. Captain America and his soldiers, including Bucky, make their way across Europe, flattening Hydra's bases one by one, with Rogers becoming quite skilled at using the shield as a projectile weapon and also discovering that it can ricochet off several surfaces and lot lose any velocity. News of his exploits reach the Red Skull and Zola. The Skull is furious, referring to Rogers as a \"simpleton with a shield\" and murders the last man alive at one of his destroyed facilities.\n\nHigh in the Alps, Steve and his men have a mission to capture Zola in his personal train. Three members of the team, Cap, Bucky and Gabe Jones (Derek Luke), zip-line across a massive chasm and storm the train car by car. Soon Cap and Bucky are cornered by heavily armed Hydra soldiers. They narrowly defeat the soldiers, however Bucky is tossed from the train and plummets into an icy river below. Zola is apprehended.\n\nZola sits in a prison cell and is visited by Colonel Phillips, who brings him a steak dinner. Zola rejects the meal, convinced that it must be poisoned. Phillips shrugs and eats it himself. He tells Zola that he broadcast an easily decipherable message, which has certainly been intercepted by HYDRA, saying that Zola had defected. He also knows that Zola is easy to bargain with since he's the sole HYDRA agent they've captured who hasn't taken his cyanide capsule to avoid disclosing information. Zola, fearing that the lie will result in his death by the Red Skull, gives in to Phillips and tells him information of the Red Skull's only remaining HYDRA base.\n\nRogers sulks in a war-ravaged bar. Carter arrives and comforts Steve over the loss of his best friend. Steve realizes that Dr. Erskine's serum rapidly regrows dead cells, making it impossible for him to get drunk. The two flirt a bit and talk about having a dance, once again.\n\nRogers and his team prepare a battle plan to take down Red Skull at his headquarters. Rogers, dressed in a new uniform, mounts a Harley and charges the base. He easily dodges HYDRA soldiers and tanks and finds himself within the base, surrounded by a HYDRA army. He is taken into custody and led to the Red Skull's private weapons lab. Red Skull asks what makes Steve so special. Steve says \"Nothing, I'm just a kid from Brooklyn,\" moments before members of his team zip-line into Red Skull's office.\n\nA climatic firefight ensues, as hundreds of soldiers under the direction of Phillips and Carter storm the base, killing many HYDRA soldiers. Red Skull flees to his private hangar, in which a gigantic flying wing, powered by the Tesseract, is preparing for take off. Steve attempts to catch up with the plane on foot, but is unable. Phillips and Carter arrive in the Skull's roadster, and the three take off after the plane. Just as Steve is about to leap onto the plane Peggy stops him and kisses him. Steve leaps from the roadster onto one of the plane's massive wheels. He sneaks into the craft where he finds dozens of kamikaze planes/missiles, each labeled with a different major American city. Hydra soldiers soon enter the room and Steve battles them, taking out numerous men and tiny planes. One of the planes, labeled New York, drops free. Steve takes off after it and manages to commandeer the craft and crashes it back into the flying wing after throwing the pilot through its rearward mounted propeller.\n\nInside the large cockpit, Captain America and Red Skull have a fisticuffs battle. Red Skull fires his cube-energy pistol at Steve who easily deflects the shots using his shield. A shot is deflected into one of the cockpit's center consoles which contains the glowing blue cube. The console is damaged and Skull lifts the cube into the air. Suddenly a portal opens above him, showing starry space. The Red Skull glows brightly and is seemingly disintegrated. His remains are swept up into the cosmos. The cube, still glowing brightly, drops to the ground and burns its way down through the plane's hull before plummeting into the ocean below. Steve mans the plane's controls and radios Carter. He tells her that the plane is on a flight-path that will take them to the Eastern Seaboard. He tells her that their dance will have to wait. He pushes the plane into a dive and crashes it into a glacier below. Peggy can only hear static.\n\nSteve awakens in a 1940's hospital. An old-fashioned radio transmits the play-by-play of a Brooklyn Dodgers game. He gets up, looks out the windows and watches as the hospital door opens. A young nurse (Amanda Righetti) who bares a striking resemblance to Peggy enters. She waits for a response from Steve, who looks her over suspiciously. He asks why the radio is playing a game from May 1941... specifically, a game that he knows he attended. She reaches into her pocket and withdraws a two-way radio. Two tall soldiers in black uniforms enter the room, and Steve easily tosses them through a wall. Steve steps through the hole and is surprised to see that the 'hospital' is in fact a movie-set. He runs through the dark corridors, pushes a door open, and finds himself in a modern skyscraper bustling with people in business suits. He flees the building and finds himself in Times Square, circa 2011. He peers around, shocked by his surroundings, and watches as numerous matching black SUVs encircle him.\n\nNick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) appears and carefully speaks to Steve. He tells him that he's been asleep, in ice, for 70 years, in a state of suspended animation. The hospital set was meant to gradually introduce him to modern society. Still perplexed, Steve breathes heavily and sadly tells Fury that he had a date, as he realizes everyone else he used to know in the 1940s is long dead or very old now.\n\nIn a post-credit scene, Steve is in an old-fashioned gym. He pummels a punching bag so hard that he knocks it off its chain and sends it flying across the room. Fury enters the gym and asks Steve if he's had trouble sleeping. Steve cynically asks if Fury has come with another mission. Fury replies in the affirmative.\n\nSuddenly we see images of all the superheroes, who include Steve/Captain America, Thor (from the movie of the same name), Tony Stark (from the 'Ironman' movies), Hawkeye, Black Widow, Bruce Banner (from 'The Incredible Hulk') and other Shield agents preparing for battle. Fury tells him that \"they're up.\" His personal mission to build an army of superheroes is complete, previewing The Avengers."

        "reviewText": "It's a film that future generations will still be gushing about, much like previous generations did with such classics as Star Wars and Indiana Jones. It may not be perfect, but The Avengers lives up to its promise and delivers quite a punch. I feel The Avenger struggles as most superhero movies do with finding a way to naturally introduce its characters in a way that doesn't seem forced or formulaic. They do a decent job for what it is, but there are certain times you will feel the campiness of older works coming on as you view the film, and truly you just have to sit through it to get to the action that eventually will be at hand. Besides that though, there isn't many flaws. The acting is rather good, Samuel L. Jackson may take a line too seriously or too, but it's all in good fun. Again Tom Hiddleston as Loki is a major standout, and I also enjoyed the return of Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man and Chris Hemsworth Thor- as well as an improved performance by Chris Evans as Captain America and a great performance from replacement Hulk actor Mark Ruffalo. The action scenes are exciting and tense, there is some camera angles here and there that can be a bit annoying, but for the most part it is rather clear and not awfully tedious action- as many films of this type could be. In the end, despite its campiness and formulaic actions- The Avengers is an incredibly fun time. It takes pride in its stories and characters and makes the most out of an experience that could have easily been phoned in. Its a film that will live on for some time, and one i'm rather glad I got to experience first hand.\n\nMy Rating: 9.4/10.",

        "reviewText": "Marvel's The Avengers (2012) is an awesome descent MCU superhero action flick that is spectacular and a real good one. The first time I watched it on my computer I loved it. I have seen this movie many times in the row I have this film on DVD and Blu-ray. The movie features an ensemble cast that includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddleston, Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders, Stellan Skarsg√•rd, and Samuel L. Jackson. Joss Whedon did a fine job directing the film and I loved it is definitely in my top 10 favorite MCU superhero films. In the finale battle in New York the moment right there.. WILL NEVER... EVER.. BE AS COOL.. LIKE THIS WAS A COMIC MASTERPIECE.. I don't even read comics, but I did superheroes when I was younger.. I have a feeling justice league will never have this cohesion... this team work.. and will never be able to recreate this feeling.\n\nRobert Downey Jr. does a good job as a Iron Man he has a lot of good moments when he talks with Loki. In the third act he has to fight Thor that was cool then in the third act he had to do a lot of stuff, did the final stuff to safe the world. He is very much star of the film, that is why he number 1 star of the film he was payed a lot of more money then the other actors did ,but he deserved it he did a good job. Chris Evans as Captain America was spectacular I love his character I love how he defended and safe those people in the restaurant against Loki's army I thought that was descent. He does kick some ass when Thor hits him he uses his shield when SHIELD's ship was attacked he and Iron Man were trying to fix the ship I loved that. \n\nMark Ruffalo was okay as The Hulk I thought he was better than Edward Norton's Hulk at least that is my opinion. Chris Hemsworth I liked him as Thor he was great. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow was fantastic what does she do? She deals with the Hulk and Hawkeye the evil Hawkeye which I think is great. Jeremy Renner I like him a as an actor he is cool, he is mostly the bad guy in the film till the third act. In the third act he did a lot of cool stuff, he is cool with arrows. Loki he did fine the actor did fine as the villain I like him and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury did fine. \n\nIn the film, Nick Fury, director of the peacekeeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D., recruits Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, and Thor to form a team that must stop Thor's brother Loki from subjugating Earth.\n\nThe pacing to me I thought it was little boring and it was too long but the third act was really was fast paced and the movie interested how 6 superheroes become a team who turn in to Avengers I think there was a lot of action scenes in the film that were really well done. I like special effect, I had a lot of fun scenes Hulk punching Thor or punching Loki when he said is emperor. That was fun, the film it self had a lot of action it self's. \n\nIt was entertaining, the CGI was really good, Robert Downey Jr. had a lot funny moments and hilarious dialogues. I have more enjoyed Captain America because he cared more about people and of course Iron Man he saved the world from Loki's invaders. I thought it was an alright and I love it. It is definitely my favorite MARVEL superhero movie.\n\nAdmittedly the first half or so isn't nearly as epic as the final 30 minutes. And the plot isn't that original. But I got what I paid for with this flick, Awesome action with Earth's Mightiest Heroes kicking alien ass.\n\nThe Avengers in my honest opinion was better than Man of Steel because right next year DC superman movie come out that I have hated it and I wish I could have get the money back. I am going to try and sell the movie out. \n\nMarvel's The Avengers (classified under the name Marvel Avengers Assemble in the United Kingdom and Ireland), or simply The Avengers, is a 2012 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sixth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film was written and directed by Joss Whedon. \n\nI have reviewed 2 years the second movie twice and as a MARVEL fan I can say I have enjoyed this movie much more than Avengers: Age of Ultron. I am waiting now on Avengers: Infinity War and of course Spider-Man: Homecoming which is a spin off Captain America: Civil War like I said I have enjoy all three Captain America Films and I enjoy both Avenger films and I love Iron Man and Iron Man Three I am one of the fans that I liked that films. The rating I give is 10/10",

The scenes where he lands at the Stark Tower landing pad and the machines automatically took off his suit is also unforgettable. How all of the agents have different plans, and how this will create conflict, but at the end, when they defeat Loki, they are together again. This movie also serves a major purpose as all of these people have met each other for the first time.\n\nIf you have watched all of the other Avengers movies, it is pretty funny to see how they have grown with each other. The theme song, composed by Alan Silvestri took this movie to a whole new level. And how this theme song evolved in the later Avengers movies. Even hearing it now gives me chills.",

My own daughter went to the premier in New York and then went to it on opening night in general release--and was mad I didn't take her with me tonight to see it! Obviously, she loved the film as well. As for me, I liked it but didn't quite share the overall exuberance for the film. Mind you, I liked it--but I think I preferred the earlier films before the Avengers team was formed. There was a certain charm that I didn't quite see recaptured in the film. Now the film is good--it's just that what I like in these other films I would have liked more of in \"The Avengers\". Specifically, the movie could have used a bit more humor and a bit more character development. When I read the IMDb trivia, it seems that originally the film had about 30 more minutes--all showing Steve Rogers (Captain America) trying to adjust to his new life. I would have LOVED seeing all this--and less of the HUGE battle at the end of the film. For me, it just felt numbing after a while and I would have liked more of the characters when they weren't fighting. Again, however, I DID like the film....but the earlier Marvel/Disney films I liked just a bit better. Just my two cents worth...",

True, the story is formulaic but not to the extent that was too distracting. In fact my only two complaint was to do with one performances that didn't quite work personally. And that was Jeremy Renner who was rather on the dull side as Hawkeye, whose character development did seem a little rushed and underwritten, that Hawkeye has inner demons is made very clear but it could have come through more strongly. However the rest of the performances were great, a big shout out going to Tom Hiddleston who is serpentine personified as Loki, though Robert Downey Jnr's charismatic Iron Man, Samuel L. Jackson's no-nonsense Nick Fury, Mark Ruffalo's very confident Hulk(he doesn't make you miss Eric Bana or Ed Norton), Chris Hemsworth's dynamic and not wimpy Thor(if he was I put it down to his hidden demons character development) and Chris Evans' modest, heartfelt Captain America were equally great. Scarlett Johansson convinces mostly too, Black Widow's back story is intriguing and Johansson is wonderful when she acts fearless but when in her emotional, imploring moments her acting is rather forced and out of character for Black Widow. For a film with as many characters as seen here, Avengers Assemble still makes a vast majority of them very interesting(only Hawkeye really disappointed), in character and not one-sided and all of them have their turn to shine. It didn't feel to me like a film that tried to cram in too many heroes all at once for the sake of it. The film is very slickly made with astounding special effects and dazzlingly executed stunt-work. Alan Silvestri's score pulsates with power and the action sequences are exciting. The story may be formulaic and standard good-and-evil but is crisply paced and intelligently handled with just the right blend of humour, pathos and action with not one component over-shadowing the others. What was really enjoyable especially was the toe-to-toe with Thor and Iron Man and Hulk. What was really remarkable was the script, filled with thoughtful exposition and snappy banter that stayed true to The Avengers while also with Joss Whedon's own style that was apparent in a lot of his other work. Overall, Avengers Assemble may not be 100% perfect or among the best ever but it is still an outstanding film with a lot to love about it, and no this is not coming from a fake account or a plant, just someone who can be hard to please who genuinely enjoyed it. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

I purposefully avoid hyping myself for movies because when expectations are too high, nothing seems to be able to reach them. I usually avoid the hype train whenever possible. That said, I was jacked to see this movie and was fully aboard the hype train. It couldn't be helped. So, I was certainly open to intense disappointment had this movie not been good. I'm so happy to report just the opposite has happened.\n\nThe only word I can think of to describe this movie is AWESOME. It's amazing work and everything I had hoped for and more. It's exceptional entertainment for the uninitiated but it has everything a fanboy could want to be sure. It has every little nuance of what a fanboy wants to see. One of the MANY things I loved was the tension and flat out conflict that arises between team members. It's not a two dimensional \"team wonderful that bands together to fight crime ho ho ho.\" Most don't like each other at fist and there is so much texture to be played. That is great because so many of these characters are larger than life. They have egos and the big guns aren't used to working with other people or even playing by the rules. Stark, Thor and Banner all work \"the other side of the fence\" so to speak. Then there's the Widow, Hawkeye and Captain America who are used to following orders and playing within a command structure. They are all thrown together in a wonderful and, best of all, believable fashion. Again, more than I ever dreamed possible.\n\nThe entire cast really delivered. You needed more than just action actors or stunt doubles to play all these parts. The pathos is there but so are the timing and true deep performances. Look, I was missing Ed Norton as much as anyone on that hype train I talked about but I'm so happy to say that Mark Ruffalo won me over. I hope he's locked up for the long haul because we don't need any more changes. Three was the lucky number for movie Banners. Every other actor in Avnegers that we've seen before is BETTER than their previous incarnation (EVERY single one) with the possible exception of RDJ as Stark. He's great but it's hard to top his take on the character from the original Iron Man in an ensemble movie. I also have to fully disclose that I'm insanely attracted to Scarlett Johansson. I thought her Widow character was amazing but I'm definitely judging that through rose colored glasses. The character arcs that run there course during this film will surprise a lot of general audiences expecting nothing more than a Transformers type popcorn scarfdown.\n\nI honestly don't want to give away ANY of the movie with this review because this is one film that needs every scene to be savored. Do yourself a favor and remain unspoiled. It's how I saw the movie (apart from what the trailers showed) and even though you're obviously reading this review, read no others with any kind of spoilers whatsoever. Experience the awesomeness for yourself. Avengers as a movie and as a team on screen is an unstoppable force. I'm just going to say, Hulk & Thor combination equals AWESOME and leave it at that. This movie defines MUST SEE.",

        "reviewText": "I'm sorry to say The Avengers isn't a good movie; it's a GREAT  MOVIE!!!! It's not only the best team superhero movie ever made, but it  may just be the best comic book adaption made period!  The Avengers is the culmination of what began in Iron Man; and  continued through The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain  America. It was only a few years ago that my son and I had just  finished watching Iron Man and as the credits were ending, Samuel L.  Jackson appeared on screen as Nick Fury and spoke to Tony Stark about  joining Avengers Initiative¬Öin that short scene, the framework for  potentially the greatest comic book movie of all-time had begun!   Director Joss Whedon, most known for the T.V. series Buffy The Vampire  Slayer, takes the foundation that was built in the prior films and  brings together the greatest team of superheroes in film history, The  Avengers: Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain  America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk/Bruce  Banner (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye  (Jeremy Renner) as \"assembled\" by Nick Fury. Whedon's scripts usually  include clever banter, gripping action sequences and an air of mystery  and The Avengers is no different. Whedon has an utter love for comic  books, and it is proudly put on display in The Avengers.  The cast does a great job of bringing these iconic characters to life,  beginning with Robert Downey Jr. Unlike Iron Man 2, in which Downey  seemed to skate through scene after scene, Downey plays Stark almost  effortlessly, delivering his lines with relative ease allowing his  charisma, charm and smugness to shine through; Robert Downey Jr. IS  Tony Stark! Chris Evans' solidifies himself in the role of Captain  America. He was very good in his solo film, but truly owns the role  standing alongside Iron Man and Thor. Chris Hemsworth's Asgardian god  Thor has some incredible battle scenes and indirectly provides one of  the film's most funny moments. After being seriously underutilized in  Iron Man 2, Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow is provided a back-story,  which helps in developing the character and provides an opportunity to  prove she is much more than just a pretty face; she's as dangerous  psychologically as she is physically. I could envision myself enjoying  a beat-down at the hands (and feet) of Black Widow. The character I was  most concerned about being given little story and the least amount of  screen time was Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye; happily, he's not left by the  wayside and does a more than admirable job of developing the character.  Hawkeye stands alongside Robin Hood and Katniss Everdene (The Hunger  Games) as the best archers to grace the silver screen. I'd like to see  more of him in a film of his own. Mark Ruffalo, the most recent choice  to play Hulk, is far better suited to the role than Eric Bana (The  Hulk) and Ed Norton Jr (The Incredible Hulk). Ruffalo looks more the  part of the nerdy scientist Banner and plays the part without looking  angry in every scene. In The Avengers, the Hulk is at his most  impressive, both in his on-screen transformation and the violence he  displays when the opportunity calls for him to \"hulk out\". If any  character appeared to stand out a little bit more than the others, for  me it was the Hulk. Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury is finally more than  just the guy making surprise appearances. Fury is finally able to  stretch his legs some, and Jackson slides quite easily into the role.  Clark Gregg's Agent Caulson returns, and Cobie Smulders makes her  Marvel films debut as Agent Maria Hill, and she is a welcome addition.  The film's main villain is Thor's adopted-brother Loki, played by Tom  Hiddleston. You would think the part would be a difficult one to play  being opposite such powerful personalities and strong characters, but  Hiddleston does a fantastic job; the performance should not go  unnoticed, because it's one of the strong points of the film. Loki is  not a villain without purpose and Hiddleston comes across as a devious  mastermind without being cartoonish.  At a running-time of 2+ hours, The Avengers is well paced and time  flies by. The effects are top-notch, the acting is very good, and the  script drives the movie elevating its strengths. For viewers that may  not have seen any of the other films (and if so, why not!?!?), we're  provided just enough information to bring everyone up to speed without  feeling overdone. Whedon provides more than just a standard comic book  film, but a story with reason that's backed up with incredible action  and humor.   Although the film is filled with larger than life characters, none are  short changed; each character is given at least one great scene to work  with, and the opportunities don't go to waste. The film's finale  provides a deafening crescendo of action that is breathtaking. As usual  with Marvel films, be sure to stay around for the post credit sequence,  which provides a surprising reveal.  I went into The Avengers with unfairly high expectations, due to all of  those that were involved, as well as the films that came before it.  After viewing the initial trailers and not being blown away, I had set  myself up for disappointment. It was only a matter of minutes after the  film started that I was put at ease, and just minutes later when my  expectations were blown away. I never imagined that it was possible to  put onto the screen, what I was watching. I'm happy that Marvel had the  sense to keep these properties to themselves and to move forward with  these characters in the manner in which they did. Marvel Studios and  Disney are going to make a boatload of money off this film, and  deservedly so; because there's never been another movie made of its  caliber.  Grade: A+",

        "reviewText": "If you're a fan of epic adventure movies, then this is your dream come true. This is the type of film you fantasized about growing up! It really is the ultimate superhero mash-up and it's done perfectly. The makers of this film certainly understand spectacle but they also get the intricacies and depth these type of characters can provide. That right there assures this instant classic will be thought of as the best as well as the biggest film of 2012. The depth of this movie really did surprise me. Even though the high quality of the actors involved and there previous work as these very same characters seemed to indicate otherwise, I was expecting a wild popcorn movie. I was wrong in thinking it was too much to convey in one film. I couldn't be more pleased because they balanced everything masterfully. Sure, there's the popcorn fun we were all expecting but there's also a definite soul to the film and a smart plot as well. It's truly a stupendous movie regardless of genre.\n\nMarvel did it, they pulled off the culmination of a master plan that's been taking shape for years. They deliver a movie the likes of which we've never seen before and as good of a film that's ever been made in its genre.\n\nThere's a reason this grand of a movie has never been attempted before now. How do you fully flesh out, care about and establish this vast group and still deliver a fun, crisp and coherent story? It's extremely difficult to navigate that edge-of-your-seat excitement while at the same time caring about each one of the characters and their struggles. One of the most impressive aspects of The Avengers is that they managed to get each hero their time in the spotlight and their own character arc. Every single main lead steps up and is treated with remarkable intelligence and given room to shine.\n\nI loved that the stakes in this film are ridiculously high and the threat so impressive that there really is a need for these diverse characters to come together. That could have been a stumbling block in terms of story but it's treated just right. It's also a great idea that they chose to introduce all the characters to the audience as if you've never seen them before. Sure, the other films set up and give depth to each character but even if you missed their solo films, you'll still know and care about them in this movie.\n\nIt's also wonderful that everything is as big as it should be. This truly is the comic book epic of our lifetime (the fanboy version of Gone With The Wind circa 1939 if you will) and it all shows up on screen. Everything looks GREAT and feels epic. The equipment (love that Helicarrier), the relationships, the stars, the characters themselves and the battles are all huge and as fully mesmerizing as they should be. There are scenes that are emotional and there are scenes that are going to make any audience member scream \"BADASS!\" and mean it.\n\nI'm serious when I say that the big, explosive moments are as grand as they should be but it's the smaller character moments in this film that really take it to another level. At this point, we've all seen how good some CG action can get but grounding it with a great story and with meaningful quieter moments is what makes a movie good. That's the ace up the Avengers sleeve. This is NOT some CGI video game movie. Cut out the action and I'd still want to see this movie. So, it's safe to say that they are replicating the comic book experience on the big screen. Years of depth coupled with spectacle and advanced fiction is a treat for non-comic book and comic book fans alike. That's is The Avengers greatest power... the ability to entertain all comers!",

        "reviewText": "Loki attempts to enslave planet Earth.\n\nThis is an entertaining movie with impressive spectacle and solid character moments.\n\nThe plot for me is okay, as Loki and the Chitari never truly feel like a plausible threat. However, the character time it gives to various superheroes is exceptionally good.\n\nPutting so many comic book characters on the stage at the same time is a difficult concept, but this is done well with some excellent dialogue and creative uses of their powers in various situations. Some of the banter from characters like Black Widow, Iron Man, Loki and Captain America is wonderfully written and delivered.\n\nThere are some fights that feel a bit forced to bring fanboys fantasies like Thor v Ironman or Thor v Hulk to life. However, they are admittedly fun to watch. What does get a bit much is the sheer volume of hyperkinetic CGI heavy action sequences. They are fantastically designed but for me there is too much of it. Personally I would have replaced some of this with quieter character moments but this is just a matter of taste.\n\nIt goes without saying that all the visuals are high quality throughout the film. My favourite sequence is the Stuttgart scene, which is beautifully filmed, edited, scored and climaxes with some heroic posturing from the Avengers.\n\nWhen the Hulk goes o the rampage in the Helicarrier, there is a brilliant scene transition from him punching someone through a wall to a shot of Iron Man emerging from a similar shaped hole in a different wall.\n\nThe climactic battle scene is a massive piece of spectacle and it includes some of the most impressive effects and CGI sequences in recent years. At the risk of sounding like a killjoy, some of the impressive feats of heroism performed by the Avengers do seem like they have been included for the sake of coolness, such as no look shots and other solo moves.\n\n'The Avengers' contains a number of solid performances. For me Scarlet Johansson has the most powerful screen presence and Mark Ruffalo makes a perfect Bruce Banner. Robert Downey Jr is as charismatic as ever, whilst Chris Evans, Chris Hemswoth, Samuel L Jackson and Jeremy Renner are all solid. Tom Hiddleston is a lot of fun as Loki.\n\nFor me it is an 8.5/10 but I round upwards.",

I won't deny that Stan Lee created a diverse variety of do-gooders in the Marvel Universe. \"The Avengers\" (not to be confused with the 1960s TV series) is entertaining enough. It's nothing special - much of it is sensory overload - but it's nothing that it doesn't pretend to be. Loki is the common suave but malevolent villain. He could trick anyone into thinking that he's a decent person. This movie will definitely please the Leonard Hofstadters, Sheldon Coopers, Howard Wolowitzes and Raj Koothrapalis of the world.\n\nIt was a pleasant surprise to see that one of the people in the World Security Council got played by Jenny Agutter (the nurse in \"An American Werewolf in London\").

While the heroes' stand alone films doesn't have that enough action, this movie executes more of their super abilities. It's really fun and exciting. A lot of people will cheer to their favorite superheroes. This is what all fans and moviegoers want in Avengers. More fighting, more explosions, more smashing, and more fun. In the end, you will crave for more because of its awesomeness. The Avengers is simply marvelous.\n\nOur modern blockbusters are just full of explosions that makes no sense, bland characters, and too long runtime. The runtime here is long but it's necessary. The storytelling is quite simple as it gets. We already knew who these characters are. The best part is when they develop their relationship to each other. This happened mostly in the second act. These scenes are funny and entertaining. It's more entertaining when there's Robert Downey Jr. stealing the show. Of course, he will always be like this. His chemistry with Bruce Banner is wonderful. Two geniuses working together. Other than that, the rest of the performances were also good. Chris Hemsworth is just mighty enough as Thor and Chris Evans is cool enough as Captain America. Scarlett Johansson is probably the weak link here. She's still sexy though.\n\nMaybe the only problem here is the secondary villains. They are not as dangerous or as threatening as they suppose to be which makes it too easy for Hulk to smash them. But it doesn't matter because there's Loki stealing all of his scenes once again. Tom Hiddleston is simply fantastic as Loki. The action is pretty awesome. It's suppose to be awesome! The Hulk nails it in these scenes. It's exciting to see him smash stuff with glory. While there's Iron Man flying, Thor wielding his hammer, Captain America throwing his shield, and Hawkeye shooting with his archer. More explosions, just what everyone wants. It's fantastically cool and fun.\n\nThere are still compelling moments and drama here but the main attraction of this film is the action and explosions. The film also cares about the characters which makes it reasonable for us to care about them and cheer to them. It's a rare kind of blockbuster these days. It has clever humor, awesome action, and really fun characters. It makes the Fans and Moviegoers happy and amazed. This is the kind of blockbuster that people should watch. This film is just cool and highly recommended to see this summer. Though, I still think the first Iron Man movie is the best of this set, but still, this is a big, fun experience you will have in the big screen.",

        "reviewText": "As you well know by now, \"The Avengers\" is a large-scale superhero film that was four years in the making, with no less than four individual - yet inter-connected superhero films - feeding into this film's overall story. Joss \"Firefly\" Whedon was the director and co-writer on this highly ambitious project that is an adaptation of the Marvel Comics superhero team co-created by Stan Lee (who also appears in a very small cameo, like almost every other movie adaptation of a superhero he had a hand in creating) and the late Jack Kirby. Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Natasha Romanoff/The Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson), and Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) are the six misfits chosen by Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Samuel L. Jackson) to defeat the traitorous Asgardian misfit Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and his alien army from laying waste to New York City. And of course, six characters usually accustomed to working alone have to work out their differences and come together as a team to save the world. What gets \"The Avengers\" many points is that beside its big action sequences, fights and special effects, we never really lose sight of the characters (who are usually relegated to the background in a movie like this) and who they are. I liked that the movie actually spent time developing the individual characters so that we get to know them all over again - even though they've all already appeared in previous superhero films. It's all big superhero fun, with a knowing wink and an outstanding sense of humor that manages to elicit some strong laughs from anyone viewing this thing with an open mind. Sit back and enjoy!\n\n10/10\n\nP.S.: What happened to Dr. Henry \"Hank\" Pym/Giant-Man and Janet van Dyne/The Wasp? Weren't they part of the original Avengers team line-up (before \"The Avengers #4\" when Captain America became team leader, marking the character's Silver Age debut)? This was my only real complaint about \"The Avengers.\"",

        "reviewText": "The MCU had estavlished itself as an interesting project since the start - there were some hit and miss movies, but it was overall an imaginative concept.\n\nThen came the moment everyone had been waiting for, the big culminatiom that had been promised for years - and with Joss Wheadon at the helms, it sure doesn't disappoint.\n\nLike the MCU overall, it has a very fun and lighthearted feeling reminiscent of films like Str Wars, which is much appreciated. It is a very colourful cast of different and memorable characters, all memorized by great actors. The main antagonist Loki establishes himself as one of the most interesting and complex movie villains of all time, whether he's tragic, spiteful, mildly heroic or just pure evil, he's a joy to watch.\n\nA main draw in these movies, of course, are the effects and action scenes and they sure doesn't disappoint. The movie gives us some of the biggest and most epic scale battles ever seen on the silver screen, and it's simply mind blowing. The cinematography is incredible as well.\n\nOverall, a fun and epic movie that was years in the making and once and for all proved how successful the Marvel Cinematic Universe was.",

        "reviewText": "As a reviewer, I don't mess up often but, just like the line where Stark is ribbing Loki, sometimes even an IMDb top reviewer can have performance issues.\n\nMy first view, I was annoyed that so much time was spent on backstory and it took an hour to get the ball rolling. Although in fairness once this story starts to move in the second hour, it MOVES.\n\nBy my third viewing I could see the issue. I grew up with these characters and I had expectations. The expectations were incorrect, I now know, because those expectations were the reason the Marvel library was such a mess before the arrival of the Whedon Bros.\n\nSo what Joss did was analyzed what was not working in past Marvel films then de-constructed the Avengers story, then build a film which could act as a base for future sequels, wit ha solid foundation.\n\nAnd wrote a script to die for. By the third time around I was actually listening to the film instead of just watching, and boy can that guy write.\n\nLike the line I posted as the title of this review. It took me 3 viewings to catch it. It is sly, it is sexual, and it is totally easy to overlook in all the action. But I was on the floor laughing.\n\nSo there you go, it is fun, action packed (last hour), written at an Oscar level, the characters are perfectly cast (except the Nick Fury I grew up with was Caucasion, but I guess no one remembers) and, to keep the suits happy, not only made a bundle on its own but launched a new franchise.\n\nSo that's a 10\n\n***********************************************\n\nATT IMDb READERS IN THE BLIND -- ATT IMDb READERS IN THE BLIND\n\nJust watched this for the 8th time and want to update my review. As of this year (2017) this is, at the same time, one of the best \"action\" films in the history of the medium and one of the best scripts in the history of action films. I believe Joss received only one award for the screenplay, which is a pity, because it shows that the industry simply does not respect this genre. The little twists and turns that hold viewer attention like glue (\"I'M ALWAYS ANGRY\" \"PUNY GOD\") are a Whedon trademark, and massively under-appreciated. I will also suggest that nothing with the Marvel brand that has arrived since Avengers I has been this good -- and I am including all their TV and other off-cable projects in that comment. The only flaw, and I mean the ONLY one, is that the close of this film sets an entire armada of \"politically correct\" followups having to do with the public blaming superheroes ... for being superheroes. Personally, as a superhero fan for over 60 years, I think that entire arc sucks and one day Marvel will figure that out. Otherwise perfect film!",

The idea of putting all the superheroes in one film is a good idea, because viewers get great value for the price of a ticket. The stellar cast and the constant action is quite amazing. The visual effects are great, especially the finale which lasts for an hour! The massive destruction of Manhattan is literally earth shattering, I was quite in awe of the aliens flying through the skyline, and all the action that goes on. \n\nI enjoyed the film a lot.",

Sure they spent a lot on effects and a grand battle scene at the end but throwing money at a movie doesn't help a weak story.\n\nThis screenplay is weak - it is a overlong with has some rather strained dialog between the leads. The weakest thing about the story is why the evil guy wanted to wreak so much havoc without much reason. It just felt a bit contrived and isn't very involving. Don't feel for any of the characters.\n\nThere is some wit and humor from Scarlett's deadpan Black Widow and Robert Downey's rather lame one liners. \n\nWhat happened to the charm of the old action hero movies?",

      "text": "Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), director of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, and Logistics Division), arrives at S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters outside of Santa Fe, New Mexico, during an evacuation. The Tesseract, an energy source of unknown potential, has activated. It opens a portal through space and the exiled Norse god Loki (Tom Hiddleston) steps through, carrying a strange spear with a blue glowing tip. Loki takes the Tesseract and uses the spear to take control of the minds of several SHIELD personnel, including Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsg√•rd) , and Agent Clint \"Hawkeye\" Barton (Jeremy Renner), to aid him in his getaway. SHIELD personnel pull out of their base when an energy surge from the Tesseract causes the ground beneath the base to collapse and destroying it. A short pursuit of Loki fails to capture him.\n\nIn response to the attack, Nick Fury issues a state of emergency, telling his top agents Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg), Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders), that they are completely out of options. Fury pulls Romanoff and Coulson out of their respective assignments and sends them to find the heroes he needs to oppose Loki. Romanoff is found in Eastern Europe interrogating suspects, and Coulson pulls her off the assignment and sends her to find \"the big guy\": Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), aka The Incredible Hulk. Banner has been living in exile in India working for a hospital in Calcutta helping sick people, and has found inner peace doing so. Romanoff tells Banner about the Tesseract and its' destructive capabilities. As the world's expert on gamma rays, Banner is their best chance to find the cube's location.\n\nDuring a video chat with the World Security Council, the superiors who run S.H.I.E.L.D., Fury is grilled about his plan to bring about the Avengers Initiative. The WSC are furious, saying that it's the wrong thing to do and these people will never work together as a group. Fury says they have no other option and this is their only hope of defeating Loki. The superiors reluctantly agree.\n\nSteve Rogers, (Chris Evans) on the other hand, is relatively easy to find. S.H.I.E.L.D. has been keeping tabs on him since he was found in the ice and still alive. Fury goes to greet Rogers at his gymnasium where he finds he doesn't sleep. Fury tells Rogers that he will find a briefing packet about what's going on back at his apartment. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is seen in a new Iron Man armor that has underwater capabilities. He is installing a new electrical connection that will take his office building completely off the electrical grid allowing it to become self sustaining. He's greeted at his office by Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) who tells him that it's date night. Tony wants Pepper to know how it feels to be a genius and after an argument about how much credit she should get for coming up with the Stark Tower idea, date night is off. Coulson arrives, and Tony quickly and repeatedly tries to cut him off. Coulson hands Tony a laptop with all the data on it about everything that's going on. Pepper decides instead to go to Washington DC to get the zoning permits for the next two buildings for Stark Tower as it seems Tony has homework to do, and a lot of it.\n\nOn the airplane to the secured location - an aircraft carrier that can convert to a flying aircraft carrier, Coulson is telling Rogers about how it's such an honor that they found him and tells him about his Captain America trading card collection. They then head to the helicarrier and Rogers is introduced to Dr. Bruce Banner. The two then wonder what kind of ride they're in for. Rogers thinks it's a submarine but the last thing Dr. Banner should be riding in is a submerged, pressurized metal container. The carrier takes off. On board, they are briefed that Dr. Selvig and Loki have been traced to Stuttgart, Germany.\n\nRogers' first assignment is to go to Stuttgart to arrest Loki and bring him on board the helicarrier. Loki is at a formal black tie gala at an art museum where he is kidnapping a doctor who harbors the element they need to make the Tesseract work. While Dr. Selvig creates a distraction and Hawkeye kills the men guarding the building, Loki carries out his plan. Outside, he is instructing the civilians present that they need to kneel before him - or else, and that freedom is life's great lie. However, one old man stands up in defiance, and Loki prepares to strike him down. However, the killing shot is neatly blocked by the shield of Rogers as Captain America before moving to confront the god. As Rogers battles Loki, Tony makes his entrance to the tune of AC/DC's \"Shoot To Kill\" with full Iron Man weapons drawn to knock down the god and daring Loki to make a move.\n\nLoki quickly surrenders when the two heroes arrive, and while being flown to the high tech prison on board the helicarrier, the plane encounters a lighting storm. Rogers asks Loki if he's afraid of lighting but Loki tells him it's not the lightning that he's afraid of. It's what follows. Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Loki's half-brother and the Norse God of thunder, arrives and attempts to capture Loki so Loki can face Asguardian justice for his crimes (which will be more effective than Earth's), but Thor gets into a fight with Rogers and Tony. The fight ends in a stalemate. Eventually, Loki is taken to the helicarrier and placed in a glass cell designed to hold the Hulk. Fury explains that if Loki attempts to escape, even by merely cracking the glass, a shaft will open below him and he'll plummet to Earth and possibly be killed.\n\nOn board the aircraft carrier, the fully assembled Avengers squad is being briefed by Fury about what they think will possibly happen next. Loki is in prison and is interrogated by Agent Romanoff. Tony Stark arrives and it seems the only one of the group he really gets along with is Bruce Banner. While conducting experiments on Loki's scepter, Stark tries to get a rise out of Banner so he can witness Banner's famous party trick (read: turning into the Incredible Hulk). Banner flinches and then begins telling about how he's been unable to fully harness his abilities and that he suffered depression after the accident. That's why he moved to Calcutta, as helping people is what gives his life meaning.\n\nThe Avengers, now brought together, argue and deliberate over how to approach Loki and the revelation that SHIELD plans to harness the Tesseract's power to develop weapons, a discovery made by Rogers. Fury admits that the events in New Mexico a year before (recounted in Thor (2011)) made SHIELD aware of other races on other worlds, some of whom may see Earth as an easy target. Thor is seen asking agent Coulson about what happened to Jane Foster. Coulson tells him that S.H.I.E.L.D. has placed her in their witness protection program and that she's in a safe zone in London.\n\nThe decision was made to produce weapons with the Tesseract as a means of deterrence. As the group argues, Clint Barton and Loki's possessed agents attack the helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight. While Stark and Rogers attempt to restart the damaged engine, Romanoff tries to prevent Dr. Banner from turning into the Hulk and destroying the ship from inside. Her attempt fails and she's chased through the ship until Thor takes up the battle to pacify the beast and manages to fell him briefly with a hit from his hammer, Mjolnir. While fighting Barton, Romanoff slams him into a guard rail, and the blow to the head breaks Loki's mind control. After the Hulk falls from the ship, Thor is tricked into Loki's holding cell by Loki himself, who has recovered his scepter and releases the cell and allows Thor to plummet. Loki is held at bay briefly by Agent Coulson but is also tricked by one of Loki's holographic projections - Coulson is stabbed in the back by the real Loki. Coulson later shoots Loki with a blast from an unidentified weapon, one that harnesses the power of the Destroyer. Coulson dies while Fury tries to save his life. Thor escapes from the cell a split second before it hits the ground. Banner wakes up in his human form after crashing into an abandoned factory.\n\nFury uses Coulson's apparent death to motivate the Avengers to work as a team. Stark and Rogers realize that simply defeating them will not be enough for Loki. He needs to overpower them in a very public way so as to validate himself as ruler of Earth. Using a device built by Dr. Selvig, Loki opens a portal to the Chitauri home world over Manhattan, summoning a Chitauri invasion. Once again the group's petty differences overshadow their ability to communicate as a team, especially with Banner now missing. While in an argument with Rogers, Tony finally figures out that Loki is a full tilt diva, and that he's obviously set up shop at the top of Stark's office.\n\nNatasha, unfortunately arrives too late just as Dr. Selvig has opened the portal. This unleashes Loki's army and all hell breaks loose. The army is massive and they can't all fight them off as much as they are entering the earth's atmosphere. Tony Stark thankfully shows up, as does Bruce Banner. While fighting, Rogers dispatches NYPD cops to direct citizens into the underground tunnels and sewers. Meanwhile, the Hulk smashes, and Tony arrives at Stark Tower where he attempts to stall Loki with a drink which is used to threaten and intimidate him. As that's going on, Tony has JARVIS prepare an under development version of Iron Man called MK18 which is contained in a giant box coded specifically for Tony and has advanced weapons capabilities. Loki refuses to cooperate, saying the destruction will continue as long as the citizens of earth don't get that they need to be ruled by him. Loki attempts to take control of Stark by using his scepter on his heart to control his mind, but it fails thanks to Tony's somewhat trusty Arc Reactor that keeps him alive.\n\nThe Avengers rally in defense of New York, but quickly come to the conclusion that they will be overwhelmed as wave after wave of Chitauri descend upon Earth. With help from the reformed Barton, Rogers and Thor evacuate civilians while Dr. Banner transforms into the Hulk and goes after Loki, beating him into submission in Tony Stark's penthouse. Romanoff makes her way, with a little help from the Chitauri, to the device that holds the portal open (conveniently located on the roof of the Stark Building) and hits Dr. Selvig over the head, freeing him of Loki's control. Dr. Selvig reveals that Loki's staff can be used to close the portal.\n\nAs that's happening, Hulk confronts Loki, who refuses to be intimidated by such a beast. As Rogers instructed, Hulk smashes Loki into near oblivion. That allows Romanoff to grab the scepter and head to the roof to shut down the portal. While Romanoff is securing the portal, Stark is securing the perimeter. Meanwhile, with Fury on a conference call to the council, Fury berates the council's decision to launch a nuclear missile at Manhattan. Fury tries everything possible to stop the council from launching nukes, even destroying two jets that are taking off from the helicarrier. Unfortunately as he's about to fire on a third, it gets away and launches a nuclear weapon.\n\nTony intercepts the missile and he knows exactly where to put it - he flies it into the portal. While in the portal, Stark instructs JARVIS to try Pepper one last time. Unfortunately the call fails as Pepper is on a plane and glued to the TV with other Stark Industries executives. Tony launches the nuke at the Chitauri mothership, completely destroying the invasion. All the invading aliens collapse and are rendered useless. Stark sees the nuke go just as he runs out of oxygen and falls to what appears to be certain doom. Thankfully he manages to escape the portal just as Romanoff is able to successfully close it. Once back in the atmosphere it looks like Tony isn't going to make it, but is saved by the Hulk thanks to incredible timing. A dazed Stark, awakened by the Hulk's roar, offers to take the team out for shawarma, but they decide to apprehend Loki first. The Avengers go their separate ways. Romanoff, Rogers, and Hawkeye return to working for S.H.I.E.L.D., Tony and Pepper are seen rebuilding Stark Tower and are working on the next phase of the project. Thor escorts Loki and the Tesseract back to Asgard where Loki will stand multiple trials for war crimes from both Asgard and the Chitauri. Meanwhile, multiple TV news reports recap the events surrounding the Avengers, and while they've become worldwide heroes for to some for their efforts in New York, others are fearful and want to know who will take responsibility for the devastation.\n\nOn another video conference call with the World Security Council, Fury is being congratulated, but they also grill him that now their secret's out, this group is too dangerous for the world to handle. And Fury is glad - what happened in New York is a warning. A warning to all galaxies that if they try to attack earth, S.H.I.E.L.D. is there to defend it. And they have just the team. Fury also tells the S.H.I.E.L.D. board that the Avengers' whereabouts are no longer being tracked. They've earned a leave of absence, but will be called back when needed. He also tells the council that the Tesseract is where no one on earth will ever be able to find it.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, the Chitauri leader the Other tells his master that it is futile to attack Earth, as fighting the Avengers is like courting death. His master turns, revealing himself to be Thanos, a worshiper of the personification of Death, smiling at the chance to court her with more loss of life.\n\nAfter further credits, the Avengers are shown eating together in a shawarma joint; the team looks worn out and no one speaks."

        "reviewText": "As I was watching this movie today, I realized it's one of the most important film in mcu. It has tons of elements that are used heavily in future MCU films, eg\n\nFleshing out Hawkeye\n\n¬∞In this film we get to see the other side of Hawkeye, we learn about his family, who would played a vital role to his character's dark turn in Endgame.\n\n¬∞This movie also solidifies his relationship with Black Widow which makes her demise in endgame even more impactful.\n\n¬∞He also inspired Wanda to shake off her past and become an Avenger.\n\n The arising tension between Steve and Tony\n\n¬∞ Things started to get sour between Steve and Tony, after him and Bruce accidentally created Ultron and also Vision. And the destruction of Sokovia at the end of the movie is also one of the main reason for the Sokovia Accords, which are all part of the reason that split the superheroes in two sides in CW.\n\n Intro of Scarlett Witch and Vision\n\n¬∞Vision and Scarlett are both introduced in this film, and they both would go on and become crucial members of the Avengers.\n\nThanos had enough\n\n¬∞ The events of this film upset Thanos so much that he decided to \"do it himself\" which foreshadows the event of Infinity War.\n\n Avengers as a unit\n\n¬∞It's also the first appearance of the Avengers functional as a team. They're not just meeting and building the team like in the first Avengers, they aren't split like in Civil War and Infinity War or broken like in Endgame. They're just out there taking on bad guys, hanging out, and fighting evil robots.\n\n Hulk/Bruce banner story arc\n\n¬∞Bruce Banner started having problems transforming into the Hulk in this movie which keeps recurring in Infinity War, until ultimately resolved at Endgame.\n\n¬∞Hulk buster armor\n\n¬∞At the end of this film, Hulk left on the quinjet which from there, you know, Ragnorak.\n\n Wakanda/ Black panther tease\n\n¬∞Klaw is first introduced in this film, he would go on to become one of Black panther's main villain. Wakanda and vibranium are mentioned as well.\n\n Black widow's arc\n\n¬∞Flashback scenes of Black Widow's years of training might be further explored in the her upcoming solo movie.\n\nRagnarok:\n\n¬∞Heimdall first teases Ragnarok and the fact they will lose in Thor's vision, which prompted him to fly back home to Asgard.\n\n Ironman to save everyone\n\n¬∞The visions of defeat he saw in this film haunt him, but he was, in the end, able to use that fear to defeat Thanos in Endgame, thus saving everyone.\n\n ¬∞Captain almost picking up Mjolnir.\n\n¬∞The first mention of the word \"Endgame\".\n\n At the time of its release it was met with mixed reviews mostly because it was too muddy, yeah it had to to tell its own story, all while setting up the next four years of Marvel films. This movie deserve nothing but our utmost respect. üôå",

It's good, nothing more or less in my opinion.\n\n'Avengers: Age of Ultron' isn't too far off 2012's 'The Avengers', especially in terms of how I fell about it. I definitely wanted more from both, yet they are still satisfying superhero action flicks. I'd rank this narrowly below the aforementioned.\n\nRobert Downey Jr. felt a little flat to me as Iron Man - he still has a decent amount of moments, just not as many as you get in his individual films. All the others continue to entertain to an equally suitable level, I didn't overly like the characters of Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen but I also don't have any noteworthy negatives about them. The story between Scarlett Johansson and Mark Ruffalo didn't do much for me either.\n\nWith that noted, it is still an enjoyable ride through the 141 minute run time. The ending is intriguing, interested to see where that goes - I have a minor inkling about the mid-credits scene, given all the internet attention that has had - even for someone like me who knows very little overall.",

The task of making a sequel to that ground-breaking, monumental event film, however, and being expected to deliver on par or better results, is an entirely different beast.\n\n\"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" was definitely built on the bullet point takeaways of \"The Avengers,\" which are: Make time and space for wit, banter and humor for the sake of humor to prevent the film from taking itself too seriously; give each character a story arch and independent moments; choreography clever action sequences with well-timed glory shots. These components are in full force in \"Ultron\" and make enjoying the blockbuster as easy as shoving a lollipop in your mouth.\n\nYet \"Ultron\" is infinitely more complex than its predecessor. The number of heroes featured barely fits into a single action figure play case, meaning more subplots and back story, in addition to creating an arch of the creation and life of Ultron itself. With a plot that takes the Avengers from the eastern European country of \"Sokovia\" to New York to the African nation of \"Wakanda\" to Seoul, South Korea to Sokovia again, much of \"Age of Ultron\" is a non-stop blur.\n\nThe film opens with the Avengers leading an assault on a secret HYDRA facility where they have located the staff that Loki used to lead the Chitauri invasion in \"The Avengers.\" When they secure it and bring it back to New York, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) discover that its power source contains a blueprint for artificial intelligence, which would allow Stark to proceed with his Ultron project, an initiative to create peace-keeping robots that could defend the world in place of the Avengers should another alien invasion occur. When Ultron (voiced by James Spader) becomes conscious, however, he interprets his peace-keeping instructions as an imperative to wipe out humankind.\n\nAdded to the mix are the Maximoff twins, Pietro (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) ‚Äì also known as Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch ‚Äì who decide to serve Ultron, with the latter using her powers to give each of the Avengers dangerous visions that could tear them apart.\n\nThe fight scenes and action sequences are in such abundance in \"Ultron\" that it's impossible to remember them all, and the ones that are most distinct, such as Iron Man chasing down and taming a rampant Hulk using his Hulkbuster armor, are ancillary to the narrative of finding what Ultron is up to and stopping it. In other words ‚Äì it's all for show. The creativity of the fight choreography also gets lost in the whirlwind of action. Captain America (Chris Evans) probably does 12 different awesome things with his shield, but they happen so fast you'll be hard pressed to recall any one of them in detail. Really clever sequences are only as fun as the build-up and payoff and those pieces are given no time to breathe.\n\nWhedon does allow for pauses in the chaos, such as the swanky Avengers Tower party featuring the film's best scene, when each Avenger tries his hand at lifting Thor's hammer, or a quiet retreat to an unexpected safe house in the countryside, but it's simply a trade- off: instead of busy action sequences, we get character relationship dynamics and back story.\n\n\"Ultron\" is inundating, to be frank, but for the everything-but-the-sink mentality, it's carried by its sense of humor and a cast whose members have each proved themselves time and again to be magnetic both on their own and as part of this team. Some of the novelty has worn off, but seeing all these characters together remains a treat that even the most convoluted of stories cannot entirely dismantle. Marvel Studios truly proves with \"Ultron\" the credibility that it has built with fans, to the point that even when it gets a little ambitious and mettles a bit more (you can easily see Whedon at odds with them in this final cut), its reputation remains intact and the fans placated.\n\nAs \"Phase III\" begins, adding even more characters to Marvel's cinematic universe (and even sliding Spider-Man into the mix) en route to the two-part \"Avengers: Infinity War\" slated for 2018 and 2019, it will be interesting to see if Marvel Studios barrels along into more unwieldy but delicious chaos, or reins it in a touch. Either way, should be fun.\n\n~Steven C\n\nThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more",

While the story isn't as good as the first Avengers, the acting is still just as good, the action is even better, and Ultron isn't a bad villain, he's just an under-developed one. Honestly, the action makes up for most of the flaws of this movie and it also set up a lot of MCU films, or at least foreshadowed a lot. Movies like Black Panther, Avengers: Infinity War/Endgame, and Captain America: Civil War. Overall, this isn't a bad film, at all, but it is the weakest of The Avengers franchise.",

        "reviewText": "In 2012, there came a day unlike any other day where the worlds greatest heroes were united against a common threat and THE AVENGERS blew away audiences of all ages with the first ever comic book movie crossover. In 2015, there came another day unlike any other day and this time the world is threatened by a Ultron, the cynical critical atypical child of Skynet and Megatron...... No actually he's just a wisecracking artificial intelligence with delusions of godhood and all round evil. Turning on his creators, he threatens all life on earth with his sidekicks \"illusion- woman\" and \"not-the-flash\"....I mean, Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, and it is up to the Avengers to take him out before he can usher in THE AGE OF ULTRON. \n\nInstead of the robot dominated dystopian future that we saw in the comics, what we do get is more \"the next few days of Ultron\". No matter, it is an exciting few days with director Joss Whedon balancing the intercharacter dynamics with awesome action pieces from claustrophobic close combat, to a freeway chase, to the much advertised no holds barred beat down between the Hulk and iron man's new \"hulk buster\" Armour. All this is supplemented with beautiful special effects from Industrial Lights and Magic ILM. Flawless work befitting the movie's massive Budget.\n\nIn The villain, Ultron, the Writers have crafted a memorable though under utilised bad guy. Ultron could have been the vehicle to explore deeper themes, themes that were merely hinted at but never fleshed out. Instead, His cynical yet refined snarling courtesy of James Spader reminds me of the those magnificently passionate Super villains that were so common in Saturday morning cartoons of old.\n\nAnd that is exactly what this is. AGE OF ULTRON can be described as a true live action cartoon. The dialogue is light hearted, the story is straightforward, the tone is fun and the action is immense. And this is not exactly a good thing. Intense scenes are interrupted and spoilt with poorly placed humour and once again the story does not seem to take itself seriously. \n\nFights are over-choreographed, more like some fancy ballet than an all out battle. The fact that it cuts to graceful slow motion once in a while only emphasises the dance like nature of the fights. \n\nAnd yet the movie felt like pieces of it were cut out. The narrative does not flow as smoothly as the first with inexplicable scenes like Thor suddenly going off on his hallucination trip. Much of the premise and the characters development up to this point very much depends on the viewer watching prior marvel movies. \n\nIt is here that Marvel studio's continuity heavy Creative direction rears its ugly head. To know what is going on in this movie, one would have to watch the previous movies. Captain America the winter soldier, iron man 3, the first avengers movie. But perhaps that's the point? Force people to go buy the Blu rays or the video to rewatch and get up to speed. In the end, the real big winner is distributor Disney. Ka-Ching $$.\n\nI like a good comedy. In in a big action blockbuster, I like to believe that the stakes are real, that the dangers faced by our heroes are real, that they are really fighting for the fate of the world. Instead, we get this cartoony violence, with equally cartoony superficial story, where heroes joke around with quick lighthearted quips in the middle of a fight scene where people could die. This kills tension. And if it weren't for the magnificent effects, action and direction, AGE OF ULTRON would have scored a bit lower.",

        "reviewText": "\"People stopped being people in 1913. That was the year Henry Ford put his cars on rollers and made his workers adopt the speed of the assembly line. At first, workers rebelled. They quit in droves. Now we plug right into repetitive motions of a hundred kinds.\" - Jeffrey Eugenides \n\nProduced by Marvel Studios (now a subsidiary of the Walt Disney Company), \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" is a gazillion dollar superhero movie. Most of the film consists of dull, unimaginative action sequences in which powerful \"good warriors\" battle powerful \"bad warriors\". These action sequences - which have no sense of style, tempo and which are totally devoid of tension - are rolled out like crude, Pavlovian commands; the chemical rushes cynically demanded by corporate candy factories.\n\nBreaking up the monotony of these monotonous actions sequences are equally monotonous and equally mechanical scenes in which our heroes \"talk\", \"reveal their personalities\" and \"share their feelings\". These scenes exist, not because Marvel Studios has any interest in drama, characters or continuity, but because \"films are supposed to have these scenes\". In the Marvel universe, nothing really matters. The individual plots and over-arching plot lines of Marvel's films don't matter. Characters don't matter. These things are only present to present the illusion of storytelling. They are filler. The constituents of a factory assembly line whose sole goal is the procurement of money.\n\nYou can't have a Marvel Movie without a super-villain. This time around our villain's a Really Bad Guy who wants to do Really Bad Stuff and who ironically pokes fun at Conventional Movie Villain Dialgoue whilst actually totally adhering to clich√©s. This villain (spoiler?) is defeated. Along the way, the film \"comically\" delivers its obligatory \"one swear word\", but not before a room full of lawyers and marketing executives run up the data, salivate over pie-charts and double check with global ratings boards.\n\nMarvel Studios has a history of roping in \"irreverent\" and \"edgy\" directors. Afterall, you can't sell cookie cuttered dough to zombies without pretending it's the work of a rebel. As such, \"Age of Ultron\" was directed by Joss Whedon, a geek-king with a flair for zany dialogue. But like Tarantinospeak, Woody Allenspeak, Mametspeak and Coenspeak, Joss Whedonspeak is now officially annoying. Indeed, everyone in Whedon's \"Ultron\" now sports the same voice. Every character, be they villain, hero, co-star, robot or computer, is an ironic, sarcastic, wisecracking master of zany one liners. This orgy of flippancy, non-sequiturs and \"cool dialogue\" reeks of desperation; cool stops being cool when everyone speaks cool.\n\nWatching most Marvel Movies is a bit like being forced to watch a pornographic movie for a full two hours past the point of ejaculation. \"Ultron\" in particular bludgeons you with bludgeoning. It's filled with CGI muscle-men pounding and stomping, blowing up buildings and tossing cars back and forth, and then doing it again, and again and again and again, and then again in the sequels and then again on the directors' cuts, and then again in the reboots, and then again in the reboots' sequels and then again and again. And then a few more times. And then again and again.\n\nToday, Marvel Studios now rolls like one of the world's largest conveyor belts; factory film-making as the epitome of the self-perpetuating capitalist machine, repackaging and marketing to every inch of the world. Art subservient to product cycles, product obsolescence and schizoid brains. And all the while, the Studio keeps expanding, pushing their movies in the summer, their TV shows in the fall/winter, and their streaming shows in the spring before the cycle is repeated all over again. With the new mantra of #ItsAllConnected - ironic, considering no Marvel show/series meaningfully connects to another - Marvel moves like the cinematic equivalent of malware. And now that Disney's acquired the \"Star Wars\" franchise, we can expect it to similarly start squeezing new \"Star Wars\" movies out of its mechanical orifices like diseased clockwork.\n\nIncidentally, like most recent Marvel movies, \"Age of Ultron's\" chief villain is essentially a Western defence contract run amok. So we have another \"anti violence\", \"anti military\" Marvel film which gets its kicks from violence, mass murder and the flattering of whole cities. Lazily written and acted, the film finds actor Mark Ruffalo continuing to be excellent, soulful and layered. He plays the Hulk, a property damage loving green dude with magical pants.\n\n3/10 ‚Äì What was Ultron's age anyway? Was that dude even legal? Worth no viewings.",

Yes it is miles way better than Jurassic World and Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Terminator Genisys I have enjoyed this film much better than Jurassic World, Star Wars and Terminator the new movies. \n\nThis film is fun, popcorn, Action and entertaining action sequel flick. I like the first one but I love this one much more. The first time I watch it, I did not like this film at all, it did not work for me, but the second time around this flick was awesome and it become one of my favorite MARVEL superhero movies. I love this film so much, more than the first Avengers. James Spader made the movie for me! So much better than Loki. \n\n James Spader and Robert Downey Jr. played together in a teen movie Tuff Turf in 1985 and 30 years later they teamed together to star in a MARVEL comic book super hero film. I like Tuff Turf but Avengers: Age of Ultron is far way better film to me. I love this film so much and I will never get the backlash. Joss Whedon gave me everything I wanted in a sequel. This and the first film are in my top 10 films of all time. \n\nI waited a long time for this universe and I am loving every minute of it. Superhero movies come out all time but something like this is what I love about movies. \n\n Plot: Tony Stark creates the Ultron Program to protect the world, but when the peace-keeping program becomes hostile, The Avengers go into action to try and defeat a virtually impossible enemy's to get. Earth's mightiest heroes must come together once again to protect the world from global extinction. \n\nI really enjoy this movie I don't get the backslash and a lot of people were disappointed with this sequel that it is not so good as the first film. Age of Ultron is in my top 3 favorite comic book films. Number 1 will always be Captain America: The Winter Soldier and number 2 will be Captain America: The First Avenger, I just love those two films: Captain America is my favorite superhero character in MARVEL comic books. \n\nCaptain America in this movie is the most decent hero in this movie, he did not want the leave the island with people stuck on it, he refused too, I have seen a hero in him. \n\nPeople are keep getting upset over Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), \"oh look what they did with Black Widow.\" I saw the film and I am seeing her kicking ass or calm down the Hulk, which is a pretty ballsy thing to do. Specially for someone who has no balls and she is kicking ass and driving motorcycle, driving around shooting for Cap, helping them to get vision android to beat Ultron and she is the only one with no powers, except Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), she has the to get the thing for them. I think it would be weird to kidnapped Thor, if you put Thor in the scene duh. I enjoy this movie much more than the first film, the first film I liked okay, I like the first Avengers film. This is a fun popcorn entertainment flick that I really love. \n\n I like the romance between Black Widow with Hulk it was really good fast paced entertainment. I love Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch I like the twist by the end of the film that she turn her side around when she found out that Ultron wants to destroy everything on this planet I love that. You have Aaron Taylor-Johnson in it from Kick-Ass film as Pietro Maximoff / Quicksilver sadly he dies on the end of the film, but he saves Hawkeye and a kid from Ultron firing bunch of bullets on them I thought that was pretty decent in the film. In my opinion Aaron Taylor-Johnson did a good job playing his character. I love that they return Samuel L. Jackson to the movie back as Nick Fury and that he help them out fighting Ultron. James Spader did a terrific excellent job playing Ultron.\n\nAvengers: Age of Ultron is a 2015 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to 2012's The Avengers and the eleventh film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). \n\nYou have a lot of action in it, I also love that Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Thor, Bruce Banner (Hulk), Natasha Romanoff, and Clint Barton work together after Ultron failed to destroy them and they go in to safe house to Clinton's family, I like that. When Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) touches Black Widow, Iron Man and Thor I like that you see a background of Natasha Romanoff's childhood, I like that. I love the African shipyard you see them on a ship and I love the last stand. I love that the Vision helps Avengers to destroy and stop Ultron from extinction. Btw I love to death Black Widow / Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) she is so beautiful and charming I love her. Overall: I am giving this flick 10 out of 10 for me Age of Ultron is my #3 favorite super hero movie. I can't wait for the next movie: Captain America: Civil War.",

But with this film, Whedon wasn't given much air to breathe, with constant Studio interference and orders of certain shots to be re- done, or scrapped if not worse. Put in.\n\nSo, you thinking why is this film so bad, if you are a fan, you should love it. Well the film changes pace, very quickly and abruptly, which is a poor sign of movie making. The Characters do not act like they would usually act in the same scenario, the progression of the story is all over the place, Scene's that just have no weight or meaning to the film, but in there because it looks cool or is setting up another independent super hero movie, the Villain that is so smart, but doesn't use the internet and his ability to control everything just to wipe out everybody, but rather has this ridiculously stupid plan. The Hero's that are suppose to be smart, intelligent and some what Spanish do not see all of the stupid plot hole that get infiltrated. \n\nThe fighting was also a problem for me, it was the same. Once you saw it in the first Avengers, you see exact same thing in the second one too, and it doesn't even change a little.\n\nOverall, this film is bunched up due to the constant interference by Studio as Josh has stated so many times now.",

Besides making fun of War Machine - again - and completely ignoring characters like Pepper Potts and Falcon, there was nothing that bothered me tremendously about this film. Keep in mind that it is a comic book film with superheros that dress funny, though.\n\nThe villain is pretty menacing, the interaction between the Avengers goes well beyond killing enemies in each other's blind spot and the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver addition was interesting, though kind of condescending. I mean, if they want to ban Tin-tin cartoons for racist depictions of African people, they should stop at one moment or another inventing countries with Slavic names and filling them with helpless women and children with names just as ridiculous and toy soldier police and army forces. I am just saying.\n\nWhat I thought was better than I was expecting from an Avengers movie were the underlying character stories. Thanks to Scarlet Witch we see bits of our heros' histories, we get to know Hawkeye a little better and understand his role in a team of superpowered individuals, he see the romantic side of Black Widow and the Hulk... yes, you read that right... and we get to see Captain America and Tony Stark having ideological arguments that divide the team. Of course, they carry them with vibranium shield throws and energy beams, like men do... don't they?\n\nI loved the character of The Vision, a freak hybrid between a servile AI and a full psycho AI, holding the power of an Infinity Stone and having a 3D printed body that is half alive, half vibranium. I share his view of humanity as queer pets that you have to enjoy during their short life.\n\nWhat I didn't like is that they upped the ante of what the Avengers can do, just because they could. In the end this diminished the level of empathy that one can feel for superhumans like that and removed from the quality of storytelling. Also, another film in which artificial intelligence builds bodies and kills people. Why would it? Ultron's motivation was completely unexplored and his philosophy and references to Pinocchio made no sense at all. OK, it was meant to be insane, but even insanity has purpose and sense. Overall, I think the biggest problem with the film was that it had too much of a budget.\n\nBottom line: brainless fun, but fun nonetheless. Less humor than expected, with Ultron teasing an interesting character with his jokes, but then devolving to a classic villain in the sea of special effects that filled most of the movie. You get to know the Avengers more, as well, which was nice.",

I did not enjoy Iron Man 3 or Thor: Dark World, but really dug Guardians of the Galaxy and Captain America: Winter Soldier (Cap 2 is probably the best film in the entire Marvel series!)\n\nBased on that, I don't think I am surprised that I came out of Age of Ultron with mixed feelings. Overall it is a solid entry, but it is by no means flawless. \n\nThe good:\n\nReally liked the intro of Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. I liked the horror-movie tropes tied to Scarlet Witch (she is a Witch afterall!) and Aaron Taylor-Johnson's Quicksilver had a lot of personality.\n\nThe action, of course, was great. And Hawkeye actually had something to do in this film. \n\nThe Vision: They did such an incredible job building mystique around this character.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nWasn't a fan of that extended scene at the Farm. That stopped the movie cold. I know some people say \"It was necessary for character development\", but the previous films had done such a poor job of giving Hawkeye any character that seeing him on the Farm did absolutely nothing for me.\n\nThe romance: Ugh. Talk about forced. I like Ruffalo's Banner. I really do. I was surprised how much i did in the first Avengers, cause i'm usually not a Ruffalo fan. But I just did not see any chemistry between Ruffalo and Scar-Jo. And where was the build-up to this? Last time we saw these 2 together Hulk was trying to smash Black Widow. \n\nMarvel needs to work on their female-story lines.\n\nUltron was kind of a lame villain. I don't think there was enough build-up for him. He just sorta showed up and was evil.\n\nOverall: Is it worth seeing in the theatre? Yes of course it is. But it is not without its flaws, and sure doesn't top Cap 2.",

They personify everything I dislike about modern Hollywood blockbusters , lots of explosions , lots of stunts and lots of CGI . It's less like watching a film and more like logging on to youtube and watching gameplay of the latest state of the art computer game \n\nAVENGERS AGE OF ULTRON gets off to the exact start I'm talking about . Most of the iconic Marvel Superheroes - and the audience are thrust in to an opening action sequence . It's very vague what this mission is , something about East European baddies in league with Hydra working on some artificial intelligence . Ignore the narrative because the opening involves lots of stunts , ramping and explosions with the occasional one liner thrown in . You want action you've got it . You want intelligent , stimulating storytelling ? Go and read a book . I can understand what the producers are pandering to but I found this pre-title sequence rather uninvolving and the rest of the film continues in the same way \n\nOne thing the film does try and do is merge high concept action with character driven moments . On paper it does have a relatively good cast and it'd be a pity to waste it on overblown action but it's not really an actors type of film and while the production team deserves some credit for trying to concentrate on character but it's not developed enough to be entirely successful and comes across as rather shallow \n\nDespite this short review I'm big enough to stick up my hand and say this movie isn't produced for grumpy , middle aged men like myself , it's produced for younger people who can't get enough superhero movies and for this market the prospective audience will probably love it so much so that that'll be a contender for biggest grossing film of 2015 and we'll be getting more Marvel movies for the foreseeable future",

There is also little suspense and intrigue - just the superheroes pondering and conjuring their next mission, with Tony Stark and Bruce Banner creating a project called Ultron to act as a peacekeeping program serving as the movie's backdrop.\n\nThe Ultron project goes horribly wrong and the machine takes a mind of its own, threatening to rid the world of humans in attempts to \"save the world\" - something we've heard before.\n\nWe get to see action slowly trickle in during the second half of the movie slowly - lots of crazy CGI action during the rumbling climax. This film's plot sets the story for the next film, Captain America: Civil War, in motion.

Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) discovers an Artificial Intelligence in the scepter and convinces Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) to secretly help him to transfer the A.I. to his Ultron defense system.

The storyline might be better, since most of the characters do not show any chemistry.

        "reviewText": "The Avengers assemble once again go up against a new corrupt, A.I. Ultron (James Spader). As the troupe pursue their mission, we're given a deeper understanding of our favorite super heroes. \n\nThere are not enough words in the world to express how happy I am. As a Marvel fan, this film showcases some of my favorite comic book characters together in one plot line in a bigger and better way. When you are dealing with a sequel, as a filmmaker, you're pretty much trying to top yourself. Thankfully, the filmmakers have out done themselves here. We're given a superior conflict, more characters and action beyond epic proportions. \n\nI love this movie not only because it's a phenomenal Marvel film, but also an outstanding film in general. A movie is supposed to grab the audience and transport them to a universe with characters that not only we look up to but also identify with. Marvel has successfully created this reality. Every time I see a Marvel logo on a movie poster I'm excited to be sent back, once again, into their universe. \n\nMarvel is a genius entertainment company because they establish their characters in previous films. The Avengers are the protagonist. Every character is given their moment in the lime light but, they are not the main focus. They all share the screen and have their own personal conflict, yet they respond as team. That is not to say that there is no character development, there is. Former story lines help save time so that the writers can focus on perfecting the current story. This also leads to much stronger relationships between the characters. \n\nFor people who have no history with Marvel films, I suggest that you see some of the previous films that feature the Avengers. The reason is that you may miss a connection with the characters that can be resolved by watching previous films. Although you will enjoy the action and story even without seeing the previous films, the inside jokes and interactions between characters become funnier when you understand the past. \n\nThe action in this film is awesome! The word awesome is a very primitive word, but it explains everything. While I love to go to the movies and appreciate storytelling and 3 dimensional characters, there are times when I just want to see things go boom! Every Avenger, with his or her different abilities, works together and kicks butt. An example of this is when Thor hits Captain America's shield and causes a devastating explosion. You have to see it to believe it.\n\nMy favorite character is, Vision (Paul Bettany) an android created by Ultron. Bettany is originally the voice of J.A.R.V.I.S., Tony Stark's (Robert Downey, Jr.) A.I. companion. Bettany uses his fantastic voice to create Vision. I was excited when I heard he was going to be a new addition to the Avengers team. Not only is the acting and personality spot on, but the costume design is beautiful. \n\nThere are so many scenes that I adore, but my favorite is when the Avengers, \"get acquainted\" with Vision for the first time. This is the second A.I. the group has encountered and they're unsure if they can trust him. Vision is uncertain himself and gives a speech on why it doesn't matter because they all want to stop Ultron. At the end of his speech there is a comedic pay-off that shows which side Vision is truly on. \n\nThe moral of the film is, \"The way to peace is not destruction.\" Ultron is built for one reason - to create peace in our time. Ultron is confused on how to fulfill that mission and believes the only way to achieve his goal is to wipe out the human race and start over. However, Ultron underestimates the soul of man. \n\nI give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to 11- to 18 year- olds. There is language and intense action that younger kids might not be able to handle. Check out this film in theaters May 1 and remember, a true Marvel fan stays to the end of the credits.\n\nReviewed by Keefer B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

        "reviewText": "Spoiler free review. Let me first start of by saying that I am not a Marvel ''fanboy'' or a DC nerd. The comic book genre of films have made it to my personal top 3 favourite genres in the last decade and the MCU has been a strong contributor to that rise. I hold the first Ironman, first Avengers and Captain America 1+2 in high regard. I did not like the direction they took with Iron Man 3 (more on this below) or Guardians of the Galaxy but Winter Soldier was a gem in terms of balancing solid action, drama and levity.\n\nThat being said, my initial thoughts on Age of Ultron (AoU) are quite negative. To me, its essentially a carbon copy of IM3. There are problems which strike you repeatedly as you progress throughout the film. The 2 biggest complaints I have with AoU is 1) the tone (comedy) 2) the script/writing.\n\nSo starting with the tone. I like to laugh as I'm sure most people do, but there is a time and place to exhibit your comedy writing skills in an action film. In AoU, its a constant, recurring and predictable theme. It's not limited to one character either, everyone is popping one liner jokes as if its the Expendables and yes, most are not funny. The timing of these moments of levity are horrible too, desensitising the viewer to any impending fear of death in battle. If the characters seem so relaxed in not worrying about possibly dying, then what suspense is needed to be held by the audience? This plagued IM3 in a bad way and its arguably worse here. The comic book films which achieved great success in this regard were XMen DOFP, The Avengers 1, Cap 2 even Dark Knight Rises! Can you imagine at the climax of Xmen DOFP if old Magneto and Storm and Bishop start pulling one liner jokes as the army of sentinels came charging at them? It would kill any tension! 2) The script. I won't say too much since this is a spoiler free review, but it really feels rushed and unorganised. I watched Fast 7 around 2 weeks before AoU and I got similar vibes. Again, its not the fact that the film is 2.5 hours long or has too many characters, that isn't am excuse since The Dark Knight and Xmen DOFP shows how to navigate these theatrical obstacles. There are a few completely unnecessary subplots in AoU and useless characters which do not impact the story overall. The villain himself, Ultron is another massive let-down in Marvels already growing catalogue of mishandled villains.\n\nSo as a summary, if you want mindless action and cool CGI, which this film does offer in the form of some spectacular visual fight scenes then you will like AoU. If you are after a darker, grounded and more moving story like the trailers promised, you will be severely disappointed. Final score 6/10 and I am being kind since Cap is my fav Avenger and they finally gave him some good screen time.",

        "reviewText": "This is why I love going to the movies. For two hours, I can forget everything that sucks about the real world and enjoy watching earth's mightiest, (and gosh darn it funniest) heroes (you're welcome Cap for not using the other word). I've always been more of a DC guy, but Marvel movies are just pure entertainment. Joss Whedon may have given us the funniest Marvel movie yet. Whether it was the Thor hammer gag about getting 'it up' or not, Captain America's bad language issues, or Hawkeye poking fun at himself, Age of Ultron was incredibly fun. To top all that, and the first film, Ultron is loaded with action that feels like it's straight out of the comic books.\n\nWe open with the Avengers mid mission taking down Baron Von Strucker and the experimented on Maximoff twins. As the camera seamlessly weaves through the entire team we get Brian Tyler's brilliantly mixed score, which I was thrilled to hear they salvaged some of Silvestri's theme, that goes with each character. It was like the assemble moment from the first film was happening again within the first 5 minutes, you just don't get much better than that. We quickly get introduced to Scarlet Witch's nightmarish powers with Tony seeing his future of the Avengers dying at his own hands. I do feel like that's a quick nod to Civil War and the possibility of the team going separate ways. Iron Man started it all, so it does seem like the beginning to the end. Throughout the film we get to see different nightmare sequences that give us glimpses of Heimdall played by Idris Elba and the Ragnarok storyline. With Cap we briefly saw Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter and a little bit of the dance we never got to see. Finally with Black Widow and her harsh upbringings as an assassin. On a side note it was cool seeing Julie Delpy in the flashbacks.\n\nOnto the possibly the most fun segment of the film, the party scene. Not only did we get several laugh out loud jokes, we had jokes that I missed because everyone was still laughing from before. I'm not even sure Guardians was able to do that. The scene with Thor's hammer was especially entertaining. The look on Thor's face when Cap is able to slightly move it was priceless. Ultron's entrance is terrifying but also sort of funny? I wasn't expecting the humor to Ultron, and I'm not sure I needed it. Don't get me wrong James Spader was fantastic as the voice, but I think at times it didn't fit. The film does indeed go from one action scene too another, and if this isn't your type of movie, I don't blame you if it feels tiresome. But it never bored me as I don't think there will be a more fun movie this year. It's not like action is all we got, we were introduced to a new romance with Hulk and Widow. It's no Gwen and Peter or Pepper and Tony, but I liked the dynamic. Whedon definitely made us care more about each character this time around, as even Hawkeye became a bada**.\n\nAs a safe house, we were taken to Hawkeye's real home. It was a nice break from the action to spend time with real people without any powers. Hawkeye was just overall a much better character here. After Vision awakens with the mind gem, we head to the final battle. I was glad that this time they were able to find a way to get people to safety, with help from Nick Fury, what an entrance by the way. With so many characters using everyone else's weapons in the battle, it made for one huge geek fest. But it goes to show you how much credit Whedon deserves for balancing all the screen time. Infinity War will be an even bigger challenge, good luck Russo bros. Speaking of that, Thanos' brief but menacing mid credits scene was cool and is a huge tease. I can't wait to see how everything unfolds now that we also have a New Avengers team, led by Cap. Sure Quiksilver wont be around but Vision was really cool and Scarlet Witch was electric so I'm really looking forward to it. Plus who doesn't love a little more Anthony Mackie as well? \n\nSo there are definitely flaws to be talked about. Thor's detour midway through felt off, Ultron's humor is also out of place at times, and I can see where the action can be exhausting to some, and the amount of characters and cameos make it feel a little messy, but I just had so much fun at the movies. There are also times where things happen that feel like they should have a scene before, explaining it. I hope Joss Whedon puts out his extended 3hr long cut on the bluray. The film also feels at times that it sacrifices brains for action. But there's so much geek material here I don't think I can get too mad. I mean come on, who doesn't love that Hulkbuster fight!? I don't know how long superhero films will be around, so let's enjoy them while we can. What's next? Civil War is next, and I think you can already sense the tension between Cap and Tony. Sure, they end on good terms here, but they never really see eye to eye. Knowing how many are coming back (and possibly Spidey) gets me even more excited. It definitely seems like Avengers 2.5. Nevertheless, go experience this film in theaters.\n\n+Hawkeye is cool again \n\n+The main theme is back! \n\n+New characters turned out great \n\n+Hilarious gags \n\n+Ultron can be terrifying \n\n+New Avengers\n\n+Insane action \n\n-Some detours feel off \n\n-Ultron's humor was too out of place at times \n\nCritic score 9.5/10. Nerd score 10/10.",

I thought the plot of needing to stop a ultra peace keeping robot from trying to make the human race extinct for peace was really good, and I think James Spader did a great job playing the role. I also liked the story of the movie to go along with it. Another thing I liked was that we were introduced to Wanda and Pietro Maximoff (Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver).

        "reviewText": "Avengers:Age of Ultron my just be the best film of 2015 it started off great with a lot of action. Why I think this is the best superhero sequel ever.\n\nOkay first thing this film is action packed there is a lot more action than the first one so basically the story is still there but the action literally takes over.\n\nSecond thing is the Hulkbuster now you may be thinking is it as awesome as it looks on the trailer the answer is yes...it is a lot more awesome than on the trailer and plus that action sequence goes on for quite some time. \n\nThird thing Ultron now Ultron may have been toned down to how he was in the comics but in this film he is still as malevolent and vicious as ever but with limits obviously with it being PG-13. Ultron in this film is played by James Spader and he doesn't lack at all you can still tell that Ultron is one of the most dangerous villain The Avengers have ever faced. \n\nFourth thing the plot the film this time doesn't rely too much on it's story it's more the action that builds the film obviously there is still a story and it's a very good one there are some bits where the film slows down for it but that is really what a superhero film is about especially generation, when we rely on origin stories in superhero films. \n\nFifth and final thing does it feel like too much Disney? the answer for that question is no it doesn't see the first film really felt like it was too much Disney but in this film it's a lot darker than the first film because you see some of The Avengers literally feel pain. Plus the first film was more of a full on introduction to The Avengers and what they do. This film is far from Disney now and well in that case that's better I did love the first film too. \n\nIf you are a superhero fan and loved Ultron in the comics then you are going to love him even more in the film. This film was worth every penny and I think that well mainly superhero fans should go see this movie don't wait for it to come out on DVD just go see because it is amazing and is far better than the first. 8/10 must see superhero film.",

        "reviewText": "If disappointment had lost a literal definition, it would be 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'. A lazy, soulless sequel, that shames its prequel & also the prolific superheroes. Despite the best of graphics & stars in hand, this summer bigger suffers from a stilted narrative.\n\n'Avengers: Age of Ultron' Synopsis: When Tony Stark tries to jump-start a dormant peacekeeping program, things go awry and it is up to the Avengers to stop the villainous Ultron from enacting his terrible plans.\n\n'Avengers: Age of Ultron' has only one saving grace & that's its graphics. The visuals are marvelous & the action-sequences are expertly choreographed. But, the narrative is stilted & soulless. Also, the pace is dreadfully slow in the first-hour. I was throughly bored in this hour, almost in disbelief if this one is actually a marvel movie.\n\nJoss Whedon's Screenplay is a downer. He made a terrific film previously, but this time around, he has faltered. The Writing Material surrenders to graphics & makes very less use of its own strength. Whedon's Direction, on the other-hand, is fair. Cinematography is alright. Editing is loose, the film runs for a long 142-minutes! \n\nThe Avengers, however, do well. Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man, donning the part for the fifth time, hasn't lost his charm. Chris Hemsworth as Thor, is excellent here, while Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk, looks tired. Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America, has his moments. Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow, is passable. Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye, is a pleasant surprise here. He actually gets scope to perform this time & he does. Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Quicksilver & Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch, add freshness in the proceedings. James Spader as Ultron, is the biggest letdown. He gives the villain a hammy turn, which by no means, works. \n\nOn the whole, 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is very high on hype, but low on substance.",

      "text": "In the Eastern European country of Sokovia, the Avengers - Tony Stark / Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Steve Rogers / Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Bruce Banner / Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Clint Barton / Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) - raid a Hydra outpost commanded by Baron Wolfgang von Strucker (Thomas Kretschmann), who has been experimenting on humans using the sceptre previously wielded by Loki.\n\nThey encounter two of Strucker's experiments: the Maximoff twins Pietro (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), who has superhuman speed, and Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen), who has telekinetic abilities, and can manipulate minds and project energy. Rogers captures Strucker, while Stark retrieves the sceptre after Wanda implants a fear-filled vision of a bleak possible future in his mind.\n\nBack at the team's headquarters - Avengers Tower (formerly Stark Tower) - Stark and Banner discover an artificial intelligence within the sceptre's gem, and secretly plan to use it to complete Stark's \"Ultron\" global defence program. After many failed attempts, they leave for a victory party to celebrate the recapture of the sceptre. Unbeknownst to them, the program comes to life...\n\nThe unexpectedly sentient Ultron (James Spader) awakens, believing that he must eradicate humanity to save the Earth, and overwhelms Stark's AI, JARVIS (Paul Bettany). In the guise of one of Stark's Iron Legion robot drones, Ultron attacks the Avengers as they relax together after their party. Escaping with the sceptre, Ultron uses the resources in Strucker's Sokovia base to upgrade his rudimentary body and build an army of robot drones. After killing Strucker, he then meets and recruits the Maximoff twins, who hold Stark responsible for their parents' deaths due to weapons manufactured by his company.\n\nThe trio goes to the base of arms dealer Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) in an African shipyard to obtain Wakandan vibranium. The Avengers pursue them there, but Wanda subdues all of them except Stark and Barton with haunting visions, causing Banner as the Hulk to rampage through a nearby city until Stark stops him with his Hulk-buster armour. A worldwide backlash over the resulting destruction and the fears incited by Wanda's hallucinations send the team into hiding at Barton's safehouse, where they meet his wife and children, who had been kept a secret from all of them except Romanoff.\n\nSeeing no answers to be found there, Thor departs to consult with his friend Dr Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) on the meaning of the apocalyptic future he saw in his hallucination, while Romanoff and Banner discuss the possibility of fleeing together after realising their mutual attraction. However, Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) arrives and encourages the team to fight back and stop Ultron.\n\nIn Seoul, Ultron forces the Avengers' friend and ally Dr. Helen Cho (Claudia Kim) to use her synthetic-tissue technology, together with vibranium and the sceptre's gem, to perfect a new body for him. As Ultron uploads himself into the synthetic body, Wanda is then able to read his mind, and discovers his plan to annihilate humanity. Horrified, the Maximoffs turn on Ultron and join forces with Rogers to distract him while Romanoff and Barton retrieve the synthetic body. However, Ultron captures Romanoff while Barton reluctantly takes the body back to Stark and Banner at Avengers Tower, followed by Rogers and the twins.\n\nThe Avengers fight amongst themselves when Stark secretly uploads JARVIS - who is still operational after hiding from Ultron deep within the Internet - into the synthetic body. Thor returns to help activate the body, explaining that the gem on its brow - one of the six Infinity Stones, the most powerful objects in existence - was part of his vision.\n\nThis \"Vision\" (Paul Bettany) - proving himself a worthy ally by effortlessly lifting Thor's hammer Mjolnir - and the Maximoff twins accompany the Avengers back to Sokovia, where Ultron has used the remaining vibranium to build a machine to lift a large part of the capital city skyward, intending to crash it into the ground and cause global extinction. Banner rescues Romanoff, who pushes him into a pit to rouse the Hulk for the battle.\n\nThe Avengers face off against Ultron's army of drones, while Fury arrives in a Helicarrier with Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders), James Rhodes / War Machine (Don Cheadle) and other SHIELD agents to evacuate the civilians. While the other Avengers go to help with the evacuation, Wanda accepts the task to guard the machine from activation by Ultron's drones. However Ultron steals the Avengers' Quinjet and goes on a strafing run in a desperate attempt to stop the evacuation.\n\nPietro is killed when he shields Barton from Ultron's gunfire. The Hulk leaps into the Quinjet and forcibly evicts Ultron - leaving him vulnerable to a vengeful Wanda, who abandons her post to destroy Ultron's primary body. This then allows one of his drones to activate the machine. The city begins to plummet, but Stark and Thor overload the machine and destroy the landmass, with the Vision swooping in to rescue Wanda. The Hulk, unwilling to endanger Romanoff by being with her, departs in the Quinjet, while the Vision confronts and destroys Ultron's last remaining body.\n\nLater, the Avengers have established a new base run by Fury, Hill, Cho, and Selvig. Barton returns home to his family, and Thor returns to Asgard to learn more about the forces which he suspects have manipulated recent events, while Stark also leaves the team. Rogers and Romanoff prepare to train the new team of Avengers: James Rhodes, the Vision, Sam Wilson / Falcon (Anthony Mackie), and Wanda.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Thanos, dissatisfied by the failures of his pawns, dons the Infinity Gauntlet and vows to retrieve the Infinity Stones personally..."

        "reviewText": "Is The Avengers a good film? No. Is it the worst film ever made? No. I first saw the movie at the cinema upon its release and, at that time, I did think that it was one of the worst films I'd seen up to that point. I've watched it 2 or 3 times since then and my opinion of it has improved, well, very slightly at any rate. Apart from a pervading incoherence, I think the film's major problem is its slightness; it's only an hour and a half long and the plot is very simplistic to say the least. It's not hard to imagine audiences feeling a bit short-changed when it first came out, especially as the film was a big-budget, would-be summer blockbuster. Another big problem is the casting of Uma Thurman as Emma Peel. Thurman has shown herself to be a fine actress in movies such as Pulp Fiction but she just looks out of her depth here (I never believed in her as a top-level scientist for a second) and her English accent doesn't sound natural. Nicole Kidman, to whom the role was first offered, would surely have been better, in particular, she's displayed flawless English accents in films such as The Others and The Hours. An English actress I also think would have made a great Peel is Joely Richardson but the studio would probably have vetoed such a choice on the grounds of her not being a big enough name. Ralph Fiennes was a real enigma in this film - there was nothing wrong in principle in casting him as Steed but he looks ill at ease throughout the movie as if he'd rather be elsewhere. I can only assume he'd already twigged that the film was going to be a turkey. What's worse, Fiennes and Thurman have absolutely no chemistry between them, which wastes the snappy dialogue they have with each other throughout the film. The supporting cast fare a bit better with seasoned pros such as Sean Connery, Jim Broadbent and Fiona Shaw making the most of their underdeveloped parts. The retro-chic world of the original TV series is nicely recreated and there's no shortage of nice cars, costumes and locations but what's good about the film is easily drowned out by what's bad; The Avengers is ultimately a shallow, rushed and messy affair, severely hampered by the performances of its two leads. Handled properly, the film could have been a wonderful success for all concerned, the first chapter of an entertaining and lucrative franchise, stretching well beyond the 1990s; instead it's one of the most embarrassing flops of that decade. The original cut of the film was apparently two and a half hours long but, following negative reactions from audiences at test screenings, the studio hacked the film down to its present one and a half hour length. This doesn't actually come as much of a surprise as there is a lack of proper narrative flow to the film suggestive of chunks of explanatory scenes having been cut out. Just one example: towards the end of the film, just before they enter Sir August's underwater lair, Steed and Peel enter a phone box and Peel says \"how now brown cow?\" down the phone. The phrase seems to be a password to enter the premises but how does Peel know it? There's been talk here and there of the possibility of Warners releasing a director's cut or special edition DVD, restoring the original two and a half hour version. I think this would be a good idea and I'd definitely be interested in watching the full version of the film. It's highly unlikely to be any kind of masterpiece but it's difficult to imagine that it wouldn't improve upon the movie as it stands. At the very least you'd have to assume that it would be more coherent. Sadly I don't think the chances of Warners going down this line are high; I have the feeling that this is a movie the studio would rather forget about than draw attention to.",

        "reviewText": "John Steed is an agent for the Ministry; he is trained to perfection and one of the best despite his belief that the enemies of the past are no longer relevant. When a research laboratory into a weather-based defence system is blown up the main suspect is one Dr Emma Peel, although Dr Peel is adamant that she is innocent. With her being their only lead into the bomb, the Ministry assign Steed to work alongside her and use her to get to the bottom of the mystery ¬ñ well, after tea anyway.\n\nAt the time of release I decided to give this film a miss as I felt I had heard too much of the critics having a field day to really be able to view it with a clear eye. Years later though I decided to give it a go on the basis that each year will see a blockbuster getting a kicking from all critics ¬ñ sometimes deserved but at other time it is just a poor film that critics jump on it. However by the time I had reached the point where Sean Connery reveals his plan to a bunch of partners dressed as day-glow teddy bears I realised that things were not going to go well. Up till this point I had felt that the film was developing a nice little sense of humour that spoofs the idea of the typically English gentleman spy; however tongue-in-cheek humour is hard to do right and it is very easy to turn the film into a very silly affair that is not so much funny as it is embarrassing.\n\nAnd so it was with The Avengers, a film that has some reasonable moments but is generally an unengaging and rather silly mess that can only be enjoyed as such. The problem is, this is a very expensive film for one that is just meant to be silly and it really needed to be fun, exciting and enjoyable as well, not just feature some silly points. For me the bear costumes were silly but enjoyable (it is such a weird sight that it stayed with me) but the majority of the rest of the film were just plain silly. The weather plot was poorly done and it never engaged me once.\n\nThe cast look good on paper but they are lost in the material and can do little with it. Of course in the case of Connery, it may have helped a little bit if he'd even tried, but he is poor throughout and just looks like a man getting paid. Fiennes is well cast and he is very English, it would have been a good performance had the rest of the film got the tone even half right. Thurman is not an actress I really rate and she has turned in too many average performances recently and here is no exception. Fans may appreciate her squeezed into tight costumes but for me that doesn't come close to covering a very poor performance where she gets it all wrong. Support from Broadbent, Izzard and Macnee sounds like a good prospect but really they have nothing to do and are pretty pointless in reality.\n\nOverall this is not a laughingly terrible film, it is just lacking in any real, consistent value. Some bits are amusing but mostly it is all misjudged with the humour being too silly to work and damaging any dramatic value the film may have had. The actors are mostly poor, thanks to the material and an apparent uncertainty about what they are meant to be doing. It isn't the child of Satan or anything but I would be hard pressed to give you one reason why you should watch this.",

        "reviewText": "This movie based on the popular British TV series is such a flop it doesn't really deserve comment, but here are a few nonetheless.\n\nThis is the kind of movie making that really has you wonder if you should ever visit a theater again, when you consider the waste of millions of dollars on sets, special effects and high-powered actors that could have been used for such better causes (such as, oh, say a big-screen version of \"My Mother the Car\").\n\nAt any rate, the film got what it deserved by being universally panned by critics and bombing at the box office. It was then rushed out of theaters with the bad-film strategy that relative obscurity would result in more bread at the video stores.\n\nConsidering that Ralph Fiennes (Schindler's List, Englsh Patient) and Uma Thurman (Pulp Fiction, etc.) were at the top of their box-office draw potential, and with the addition of the always popular Sean Connery in a unique role as a villain, one would think that this movie would have been a sure hit. However, the potential went lightning fast down the tubes, greased by a stinky script, second-guessed editing and incompetent direction.\n\nThe best elements of the original series, namely, its charm and style, are absent. A lot of the charm came from the relationship between Steed and Peel. But Fiennes' Steed is aloof and Thurman's Mrs. Peel is cold as ice. The two appear to be sleepwalking through their respective roles, with visions of fat paychecks dancing in their heads.\n\nIronically, an imprudent element of the TV series that was indicative of its downhill slide after the departure of Diana Rigg (the original Mrs. Peel), namely, the introduction of the silly character of \"Mother,\" IS included in the film. Go figure.\n\nConnery 's performance as a mastermind who can manipulate the world's weather falls flat. Like Fiennes and Thurman, he appears to be going through the motions of a script he has no faith in.\n\nQuirky aspects of the original series that were cute and amusing have been replaced with gimmicks that are just unfunny strange and head-scratchingly bizarre. For example: the requisite cameo of an actor from the original series features only the voice of Patrick Macnee in the role of an invisible man behind a desk. What this character has to do with anything, other than adding to an already disjointed script, is anybody's guess.\n\nOn a website competently dedicated to the series it has been speculated that the director never saw a single episode of the TV Avengers. If you were any kind of fan, you will immediately observe that there is a good reason to believe this. Jeremiah Chechik's direction seems to lack any instinct for the flavor of the original series.\n\nAt any rate, with this brand of TV series-inspired movie making, you may find yourself yearning for \"Return to Gilligan's Island.\" Originally hyped as a summer blockbuster, the cinematic version of \"The Avengers\" is only spectacular in its capacity to disappoint.",

I would NEVER put it in the Bottom 100 as I can name many other movies that are much worse than this one (FREDDY GOT FINGERED, THE CAT IN THE HAT and DISASTER MOVIE for example).\n\nIn this full length version of the 1960s TV show John Steele and Emma Peel battle with a duplicate Emma Peel and Sir August de Wynter (played by Sean Connery), a mastermind that wants to rule the world with his weather-controlling machine. And while this plot could look stupid to some, it certainly is! But you can't do anything but admire the extraordinary special effects as well the sets. In particular I loved the special effects (the CGI insects were cool to look at). I personally can't give a 1 to a movie with great special effects and sets, it deserves at least other 4 points for the effects.\n\nAs for the acting, even though the movie it's bland Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman are good in their roles. And it was a surprise for me seeing Sean Connery in such a nasty role and Patrick Mcnee as the Invisible Jones (a small role).\n\nHowever, while the movie is a bit bad, it's watchable and far from a huge disappointment.

        "reviewText": "Frankly, when THE AVENGERS was released, I wanted it to bomb--I wanted Hollywood to finally get the idea that ripping off old TV shows is IMBECILIC and almost never successful. Thus, I was happy that the movie did poorly and closed quickly. (I also took a trip to London just as the movie was released, and if you think it was ill-received here, the British took it times TEN.)\n\nIronically, though, it isn't that bad a movie. Not great, but certainly not the despicable mess that most others seem to think.\n\nIt's been called ridiculous, slow, talky, surreal. Well, what a shock, so was the original series. I've recently viewed the entire 1967 season (bought all four boxed sets), and the show is all those things at times. It is slow, generally, at a very langorous pace throughout most stories. It is talky, since most of the charm of the original was in the dialogue between characters. It was surreal, even ridiculous (The Winged Avenger, anyone? Eeee-urp.)\n\nUma Thurman does a passable job as Emma--she's no Diana Rigg, but who is? She plays the character smart enough, although she doesn't quite capture Rigg's regal command of situation. Ralph Fiennes, however, misses the character of Steed quite a bit, playing him as reserved, without any of Steed's charisma. Steed always had a quality about him that made you feel as if he woke up every morning feeling absolutely smashing--Fiennes seems to miss that.\n\nThe problem the film faces is twofold: Those of us who have seen the original will always compare the two, and a copy can't hope to compare. Those who haven't seen the series have no grounds to assess it on--(see some of the above user comments which begin 'I never saw the original series...')and since I think this series is not exactly vividly-remembered by the majority of the population (particularly the 18 and under movie-goers, who don't have much grasp of the nuances The Avengers operated on). Frankly, The Avengers was probably just a bad choice to try to remake\n\n(--LIKE ALL OLD TV SHOWS. Tell me one old-TV remake that has ever spawned a sequel (which Hollywood is always sure to do when something is a success)-- only THE BRADY BUNCH...point proven?)",

I should've saw one of the others. I don't even remember what they are now, but it doesn't matter. I am pretty sure that THE AVENGERS is the worst movie of the decade and one of my least favorite movies of all time.\n\nJohn Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Emma Peel (Uma Thurman) team up to stop Sir August de Wynter (Sean Connery) from destroying the planet with a weather-changing machine. I won't go into the plot too deeply, because it's just plain stupid.\n\nThe acting in this movie was not very good. Ralph Fiennes and Fiona Shaw (Father) play two of the most annoying characters in any movies that I have ever seen. The constant unwitty one-liners between Fiennes and Thurman is very annoying.

        "reviewText": "The 1990's saw a vogue for making motion pictures based on vintage television shows, 'such as 'The Fugitive', 'Mission: Impossible', 'Sergeant Bilko', 'Lost In Space', 'The Beverly Hillbillies' and 'The Saint'. Most ( though not all ) were not terribly good, for the simple reason that their makers were unable to recapture the ingredients which had made the originals so successful. A movie based on the British spy show 'The Avengers' was announced as far back as 1987, with Mel Gibson ( also said to have purchased the rights from E.M.I. ) as 'Steed'. These rumours persisted well into the 1990's, when after the success of 'Basic Instinct', the role of 'Mrs.Emma Peel' was tipped to go to Sharon Stone. What sort of movie would have resulted with these leads we can only guess at, but I am glad that it was never made.\n\nJerry Weintraub, a self-proclaimed fan of the show, hired Don Macpherson to write a script that was true to the style of the original. It centred on a madman who has created a weather control machine, and plans to use it to blackmail the world's governments into paying him for their weather, or else he will condemn them to perpetual winter. It was a witty, imaginative, and outrageous piece of work. \n\nAs 'Steed', Ralph Fiennes of 'The English Patient' was cast, with Uma Thurman of 'Pulp Fiction' taking up the role of 'Emma'. Weintraub then pulled off another major casting coup - Sir Sean Connery. The former 'James Bond' was hired to play the villain, necessitating a major rewrite. The character of 'Merryweather' became 'Sir August De Wynter', who lives in a mansion called 'Hallucinogen Hall', and is so fixated by Emma he clones her. In a thrilling opening, the clone gains illegal access to 'The Prospero Project', which she destroys. The real Emma is naturally blamed, and Mother calls on Steed to investigate.\n\nThe film had a decent budget, but was not on a level-playing field with say 'Star Wars' or 'Harry Potter'; nevertheless, it boasts stupendous art direction, cinematography by by Roger Pratt, and music by Joel McNeely. Director Jeremiah Chechik skilfully recreated the look and setting of the series - Agatha Christie England - but mixed with a dose of Terry Gilliam's 'Brazil'. There is humour, but not of the 'funny ha-ha' variety; for instance, the scene in the conference room in which Sir August's henchmen are kitted out in teddy bear costumes. This was intended to spoof similar scenes in Bond films such as 'Thunderball'.\n\nOf the supporting cast, Eileen Atkins shone as the gun-toting spinster 'Alice'. Comedian Eddie Izzard played 'Bailey', Sir August's ( mostly mute ) henchman, with Jim Broadbent delightful as Steed's macaroon-munching boss 'Mother'.\n\n'The Avengers' was all set for a major launch as Warner Brothers top summer release, but then disaster struck. It registered poorly with a preview audience in Arizona ( why Arizona, for heaven's sake? ), causing it to be recalled for major edits. We shall probably never know the name of the man who butchered the film, but I suspect his first name may have been 'Sweeney'. He took out major scenes, such as the 'Prospero Project' opening, and Sir August's 'Frankenstein'-like creation of 'Bad Emma'.\n\nCut down from a two-hour running time to a paltry eighty-five minutes, 'The Avengers' opened ( rather aptly ) in August to a universal drubbing from critics and public alike. The overkill of bad reviews was enough to destroy any chance the film had of becoming a hit.\n\nWhile the film had its flaws, it certainly did not deserve the opprobrium heaped upon it on its release. Yes, Fiennes and Thurman were not Macnee and Rigg, nor were they intended to be. This was a NEW 'Avengers', intended to be a film for the twenty-first century.\n\nYears after its release, the movie has a fan base, whose main aim is to see the original restored. Its worth remembering that Ridley Scott's 'Blade Runner' was regarded as a boring flop in 1982, now is thought of as a sci-fi classic. I hope that someday 'The Avengers' can pull off the similar feat of being regarded in a whole new light.",

The reason it failed was not IMO the surreal wackiness, it was that Warners panicked and cut huge chunks out of the film rendering it not only surreal and weird, but missing links in the story that would have tied all the bizarre stuff together better.\n\nIf you look on Wikipaedia it details what was in the original script, such as the attack on the secret base by the evil Emma Peel that was seen in trailers. I also recommend reading the novelisation, which you can pick up for a couple of quid. It really is absurdly stupid how Warners had, judging by the book and screenplay, a great film and then they decided 'instead of a long movie people might like, we'll cut it down to a short movie that people will hate for sure'. They should have had the courage of their convictions, and if they had The Avengers might have been a huge success. One can only hope they pull their fingers out and release the director's cut.\n\nOn reflection there's a lot to like in The Avengers: Uma Thurman in leather: always a plus, Sean Connery hamming it up more than Porky Pig at a bacon factory, and henchmen dressed as multi-coloured teddy bears.

As a longtime fan of The Avengers (since childhood), I will say, right off the bat, that this movie did not fail on all levels.  If nothing else, the makers of this film understood, at least, what The Avengers was about.  This puts them head and shoulders above, say, the makers of The Wild Wild West movie, who had only the most rudimentary (and faulty) knowledge of what made that series an icon of popular American culture.\n\nThey might not have been successful in the execution, but they did understand what made The Avengers tick, and if the studio heads hadn't ordered extreme and desperate editing, we might have been able to see more of what the filmmakers imagined.\n\nTwo scenes stand out as perfect examples of this understanding:  When Mrs. Peel tries to escape by running endlessly down an Escher-like staircase, and when Steed and Mrs. Peel walk on water in giant bubbles.  Sean Connery's eccentric megalomaniac (so much more interesting than a serious, conservative megalomaniac) fit right in with the The Avenger's roster of enemies.\n\nWhatever sense of fun the movie had (and The Avengers tv series never seemed to take itself too seriously; does anyone remember Steed being shrunk to the size of a mouse and jabbing a villain in the ankle with a fountain pen?) was destroyed when the nut jobs at the studio fell for the old \"edit out what the test audience didn't like\" trick, and put a botched film on the screen. Too bad these studio honchos have such weak nerves and such short memories; will they never learn?",

When I heard about an Avengers movie I assumed we'd be getting a bastardised Hollywood formula movie, and it would resemble some of the recent Bond films more than the original series.  But I was thrilled to find the film had the same wonderful sense of absurdity as the show. :)\n\nI think a lot of people are unaware this is a complete comedy.  This being the case it's not surprising people think it's bad, but that's their problem.  The comedy style is not a popular one, it's a particular style of generally British humour, best described as complete and utter nonsense.  If you have no appreciation for absurdity, then you will NOT like this film.\n\nNothing in The Avengers should be taken at face value, it's all a load of s***.  Steed and Peel are full of s***, that's the point.  No one acts the way they do, they are both constantly trying to out cocky each other.  The world of The Avengers is a place where \"small things are taken with the utmost seriousness and important things are not taken seriously at all\".\n\nThe Avengers purposely doesn't explain things, it's not supposed to make sense, that would ruin it.  It's the little things in The Avengers that make it shine.  Small asides from left-field that seem to go over most peoples heads.\n\nFiennes and Thurman are different than Macnee and Rigg, but I'm not sure they're much worse.  Fiennes could perhaps have been a bit more cheerful. Thurmans whole screen presence is so vastly different from Riggs that it's impossible to compare, but I did enjoy Thurmans version of the infalable Peel.  Connery going nuts was fun to see too.  BTW Eddie Izzard not talking was the point of him being there, get it.  Having Eddie Izzard in your movie and not having him say anything is to my mind very funny.\n\nIt's very hard to explain to people who flock to films like The Waterboy, why a film like The Avengers is so funny.  Most people I guess will just never get it.  I got it, and I'm glad that there ARE plenty of other people who did too.  Congrats to the makers for daring to be different and convincing the studio into letting you spend $70 million.\n\n8/10",

        "reviewText": "This big-budget flop is not without its good points, seeing as it contains enough offhand weirdness and odd situations to appeal to most bad movie fans. Although its about as far away from the original television series as you can get, there's this retro '60s thing going on with the film which makes it pretty amusing to watch. Although the fact that the cast members are obviously taking everything as a joke does get on your nerves after a while, I consider this to be an enjoyable failure and I must admit that I pretty much enjoyed some of the individual scenes.\n\nYou know you're in for a crazy time with the film's opening, which sees Steed walking down an apparently normal English street only to be attacked by a number of surprise assailants. For example, at one moment a whistling milkman smashes two empty bottles together to use them as weapons as he lunges as Steed. This exceptionally odd beginning sets the campy tone for the rest of the film, which is not for all tastes it has to be said.\n\nPacked with cheesily overemphasised dialogue, lots of one-liners and innuendos worthy of a Bond movie, THE AVENGERS has the benefit of a huge budget to include lots of nifty (but hardly convincing) computer effects. These include an attack by a swarm of mechanical bees, characters walking in see-through bubbles and the climatic \"storm within a building\" scene which is sufficiently loud and over-the-top enough to be a crowd-pleasing event. Elsewhere, we have the ever-odd Eddie Izzard as a mute henchman, one of the least threatening ever to grace a cinema (or television) screen, and bad guys dressed up as giant multicoloured teddy bears in order to disguise their identities.\n\nRalph Fiennes (looking a lot like a young version of Peter Cushing) essays the role of the straight-faced John Steed, and is pretty good; Uma Thurman plays the leather-suited Emma Peel: one wonders why she agreed to be in such a fantastic movie again after the failure of BATMAN & ROBIN but I guess she's a glutton for punishment. Sean Connery is the non-threatening chief villain, and has had enough experience with Bond villains in order to know how to play it, but his performance is somewhat weak. Elsewhere, we have Jim Broadbent as the wheelchair-bound Mother, leader of the agents, and a funny turn from Patrick Macnee as an invisible agent (!).\n\nThe major problem is the obvious cutting that went on with the film after initial test screenings, which undoubtedly make events confusing at times. In my mind this just adds to the weirdness. See it for yourself to find out how.",

        "reviewText": "I guess there are two ways of looking at 1998's 'The Avengers' film (and, yes, it has NOTHING to do with the Marval brand that would dominate the Box Office a decade later). You can either believe everything you've heard about it, or just keep an open mind and go with the flow.\n\nIt's a remake of a British 1960s spy show about a male and female secret agent, generally saving the world with gadgets and an assortment of witty quips. The studio had high hopes for the big budget adaptation and cast two major stars (Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman) in the lead. However, close to release it became clear (from 'critics,' anyway) that the movie wasn't that good and its release date got put forward while they did reshoots, or re-edits etc, trimming the run-time dramatically. When it did hit theatres, basically everyone hated it, claiming it was a 'mess' and it now lives on only in top ten lists of movies that bombed hard.\n\nYet, saying all that, I quite enjoyed it. I enjoyed it then and I enjoy watching it on DVD every so often. No, I'm not saying it's perfect (or even that good!), but I'm saying there's enough there to keep me entertained for an hour and a half.\n\nFor a start there's Sean Connery as the bad guy, who's threatening to control the world's weather and force countries to 'purchase' their weather directly from him. Therefore, Fiennes and Thurman must stop him. Yes, it's kind of like a Bond film plot and you can expect the regular punch-ups and car chases that come with the genre.\n\nWhat you also get are some truly surreal scenes which don't make a lot of sense. Now, these could be written just to add to the film's 'kooky' feel, or it could be because the other scenes that explain them were left on the cutting room floor, therefore leaving these scenes' meaning up to our imagination.\n\nPeople also remarked on 'how little chemistry' there was between Fiennes and Thurman. I can see their point. However, it's worth noting that they were supposed to be playing cold and unflappable characters lifted from yesteryear when this kind of acting/social interaction was more common. It's a case where the film tried to copy the source material and succeeded - only a little too well for its own good.\n\nLike I say, 'The Avengers' is just about as far from perfect as you'll ever get, but it's not the car crash you've probably heard it is. And, if you're in the mood for a spy movie that's a little bit different and has a mute Eddie Izzard, a gun-totting Granny and a swarm of robot bees, then give this one a go. And I didn't even mentioned the giant teddy bear costumes.",

Uma Thurman delivers a worthy Emma Peel with more than enough man appeal to keep me starry-eyed to the screen for 90 minutes. Mr. Fiennes combines distinction, humour and resolution in a way that is worthy of Mr. John Steed. The plot is original, yet partly predictable - but aren't all of the original 'Avengers' episodes predictable by modern audiences? Isn't a Mozart symphony predictable?

Predictable views of tourist London only serve to add to the feeling that someone thinks this will all make it more 'English' & please a section of the American audience who think England is still like how it was 50 years ago.\n\nSean Connery does a good job as the villain bent on controlling the weather with his elaborate machine (nods to the episode 'A Surfeit of H2O' here), but the whole Bond-like epic climax falls flat, & goes down the drain faster than rain in a rainstorm.\n\nThis whole ludicrous film feels contrived, unreal, charmless and cartoonish.

But then nostalgia - especially when the satire was so gentle anyway - has its own charms. And there was, anyway, a hefty dose of nostalgia amidst the cool insouciance of the original. Its very modernity was made to seem almost an expression of polite insistence on whatever surreal manifestation of tradition was encountered. It was the utterly unruffled mien of the original which prevailed over all lapses from reason and good taste. So, at its best, in the new cinema version.\n\nThis is indeed a brave try by Hollywood to draw us back into that black-and-white psychedelia of swinging sixties British commercial television. The sheer madness of the enterprise almost works - if the money-men hadn't had cold feet at the last minute, we might have been enjoying a really remarkable fantasy film. As it is, we must content ourselves with a merely very amusing piece of whimsy. Even through the plot-holes left by a nervous editor we can see some wonderfully mad logic at work: The Escher-inspired architecture of the baddy's stately home, in which Mrs Peel at one point loses her way, encapsulates this whole dream-trip of a movie.\n\nAnd for those who don't 'get it', I can only say, Humour is like that: Very dependent on individual taste.\n\n But even allowing for taste, it is a sad reflection on public taste that 'The Avengers' overwhelmingly offends filmgoers who are probably quite prepared to accept the ever more overblown superheroes of a more violent tradition, such as 'Batman' or 'The Hulk'. Of course, these two are clearly representative of that particularly adolescent taste for the extreme and crude for which the contemporary Hollywood production-line largely exists. (There is every sign that Eddie Izzard's character was originally intended to satirize mega-buck entertainment and mega-buck villains as being really just spoiled brats with their expensive toys.) The genteel quirks of the English-inspired concept of 'The Avengers' are - in their essence, and however silly - just too irritatingly grown-up for such hyperactive youth ever to endure sitting still for!\n\nA pity the film was not left alone upon release to find its own friends - like a stray cat, that will carefully choose whom it will exercise it's feline charm upon. And what more feline than Uma Thurman in Mrs. Peel's cat-suit?!\n\nThis is certainly not the sort of film to toss into an auditorium full of baying first-run morons.\n\nBut I suspect that it is a film with more than one life ...",

This movie is a monstrous put-on, a huge satire, a brilliant send up of the Brit way of life and of other adventure movies. There are some great sight gags --- tea from the dashboard? Bad guys in bunny suits? --- and some clever dialogue. I'm sure it's one of those movies where you'll find something new every time you watch it again. There is a bit of James Bond, Harry Potter and Batman. The effects are great. I've never been able to figure out just where Ralph Fiennes fits. But he's perfect in this role with the impassive face and the unruffled attire. And Sean Connery makes an interesting villain for somebody who usually is the good guy. Really surprised by the low rating.",

And this is one of them, a movie that dares cast Shawn Michaels as Incredible Master Yoga, who is like the Hulk and Yoda and really this movie kind of made me sad for people like Amy Smart (whose character is kind of in the Incredibles), Simon Rex (whose Dark Jokester is the Joker as Darth Vader and no, that does not make perfect sense) and Tim J. Smith, who openly complains in character that Lando Fury is whatever ethnic character he has to be for whatever scene he is in, from Nick Fury to Black Panther to Lando Calrissian.\n\nI refuse to feel badly for the actor who plays SuperBat, Stephen Rannazzisi, a man who claimed that he went into stand-up to escape New York City after 9/11, claiming that he worked in the South Tower of the World Trade Center at Merrill Lynch on the 54th floor and nearly died. Not only was he never employed by Merrill Lynch, Merrill Lynch didn't even have offices in the World Trade Center at that point. Kind of takes all the fun out of The League, huh?\n\nDirector Jarret Tarnol (Barrio Tales, See You in Valhalla) and writer Richard Dane Scott (My Dog the Champion, Sparkle - A Unicorn Tale) have combined Marvel, DC and Star Wars into a cocktail that in no way goes down easy. The jokes are beyond easy: SuperBat is really Bruce Kent. There's a bad guy named Lisp Luthor. There's a naughty and nice side to the Farce. There's also a character named Beaverine. Thorbacca? Ironing Man Tony Starch? Was anyone even trying?\n\nOne time, they brought a stand-up in for a work function and everyone thought they were hilarious except me. As the yuks went on forever, I added up how much this guy cost and how low we were being paid and I realized I'd rather have $1 more than lame jokes using the names of people I worked with. Worst of all, my time was wasted and time is the only finite resource we have. This movie wasted the time of so many people before it wasted my time.

        "reviewText": "Essentially an origin story, this was exactly how I remembered reading the Captain America comic books when I was younger, mostly sticking around how the sickly Steve Rogers (a CG- ed Chris Evans) became the beefcake he was through a top secret military experiment, and his constant battles with his arch nemesis standing for all things Axis powered personified by the Red Skull, played to perfection by Hugo Weaving with a German accented voice as the Johann Schmidt version. At its heart it's a clear cut battle between good and evil, although in this Marvel augmented reality, Evil is aided by the powers of the Cosmic Cube and the megalomaniacal ambitions of Red Skull and his Hydra shock troops, threatening to conquer the globe unless someone can do something about it.\n\nHence the first act concentrated on the innate characteristic of Steve Rogers, a determined, never say die young chap from Brooklyn whose enlistment to the US Army has consistently been met with flat out rejections, until the scientist Dr Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) saw something in him that no one else does, and selects him as the first of intended many in the army's Super Soldier project, as headed by Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jomes). It's almost a master-prot√©g√© relationship set up in their short scenes together, but made no less powerful with nice touches about what really mattered in a world that's embroiled in a massive war.\n\nSince there's always nothing too definitive out there as far as origin stories go in the comics world, it's admirable how Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely's screenplay still managed to extract the essence of the character, of what made him tick as the beacon amongst the do gooders, and explored how events pushed the man into donning the less than camouflaged colours into combat. Allies like Howard Stark (now played by Dominic Cooper) whom we've seen in the expanded Marvel universe of films in Iron Man 2 as the military's main contractor, Bucky (Sebastian Stan) as Steve's best friend, and Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter the British agent and romantic love interest, all factored in to build Captain America's world, which if a sequel is made would be a challenge to try and set it in the 40s again since the events here were pretty much open and close.\n\nAction wise, while Captain America essentially doesn't possess super powers per se, still is the epitome of physical fitness, and Joe Johnston compensates this with large, and I mean large action sequences, coupled with plenty of montage to show the Captain's campaign against evil. And I thought there was a conscious effort to tone down the \"America\"ness of a one man crusade, and assembled a rag tag group of United Nations typed mercenaries whose loyalty is to the Captain since he busted them out from near death. His trademark Vibranium shield worked out very nicely in the fights, choreographed just as how one would imagine the real Captain America do it, with the shield featuring heavily in all fights designed that it's more than a good looking prop. I'd even appreciated effort to include the original shield Cap America used, together with a more logical reason how he had to don a cheesy looking costume that doesn't make camouflage sense, worked into emerging as an icon to rally behind in the face of adversity.\n\nSubtlety is one of the key strengths of the film, with Captain America's additional and lesser known abilities mentioned in passing but enough for fans to pick up, with numerous references in this film that's set up to reference the other Marvel films from Iron Man to Thor. While the romantic angle was severely limited, I thought the emotional resonance worked particularly well especially if you know how the Cap would eventually end up, in a way fixed by the mythos and unavoidable, being the romance that had potential and room to develop further.\n\nSome may say that a superhero film gets defined by the villain, but this one clearly didn't let its villain upstage the heroic character, which is quite rare. Not that Hugo Weaving did a bad job with Red Skull, but there are little evil deeds the Skull had significantly embarked upon besides pulverizing his opponents with no remorse, and his constant banter with scientist Dr Amim Zola (Toby Jones) to show just how egoistical he could be. Hopefully we will get to see more of the Red Skull in future sequels of Captain America, since Chris Evans signed for a total of 6 appearances. Evans too while being involved in too many comic book films as compared to Ryan Reynolds, will probably be best remembered for his Captain America outing than for his less charismatic Johnny Storm in the Fantastic Four, and balanced both the drama and hard hitting action well, believable as the man you'd trust to rally the troops and lead them in the fight against evil.\n\nCaptain America: The First Avenger ranks up there amongst the comic book based movies done right even if the storyline comes up as somewhat expected given its necessity to focus on the hero's origins. This is undoubtedly highly recommended, and as always, don't leave before the end credits have rolled off, for the first look at Joss Whedon's The Avengers, and from the looks of it, it's going to be one heck of a ride, especially when mega egos come clashing up against one another. Summer 2012 can't come any sooner!",

        "reviewText": "Considering how fundamentally 'safe' the superhero action film has become in terms of box office and reasonable standards of entertainment, selling Captain America, age-old icon of American propaganda on cinema screens in cynical and economically unstable times could hardly have been a more difficult endeavor ‚Äì tellingly, the film was marketed simply as The First Avenger in Russia, the Ukraine and South Korea. Indeed, skepticism and uncertainty have riddled the development of the project, which was first pitched as a Jon Favreau \"action comedy\" and later as a brutal, gritty, self-critical postmodern war epic. Such tonal fluctuation mirroring the social/political climate demonstrated that having a successful film with such a politically entwined protagonist, was anything but 'safe' ‚Äì it's hard to imagine Peter Parker being subjected to the scrutiny of \"military propaganda\" or \"patriotic cheese\" that beset Steve Rogers. \n\nWith this in mind, all the more credit can be given to Spielberg-cohort Joe Johnson for delivering what is ultimately the first comic book film that properly feels like a cartoon brought to life. Pitching strictly for nostalgia, Johnson bravely girds his film with the unabashed gee-wiz charm and heart of a 1940s Saturday morning adventure serial. In the process, without consistently tripping over political correctness, Johnson neatly circumvents concerns of propagandistic exploitation by delivering a film too bombastic, too colourful, too cheerily old-fashioned to be taken seriously enough as any kind of coy ideological manipulation. It's hard to imagine any contemporary audiences, cine-literate or not, being swayed to join the army by witnessing Captain America's hilariously cringe-worthy war bonds tour, arguably the film's strongest and most self-aware sequence. Even a couple of brazenly Spielbergian montages - conflating Captain America's early triumphs or the Red Skull's past crimes into a series of dramatic snapshots - somehow function as endearing and in keeping with the boldly cheerful feel, as Johnson keeps the pace whipping along with an engaging sprightly bounce, accompanied by Alan Silvestri's soaringly heroic musical score. \n\nIndeed, Captain America comes across as more of a vintage science-fiction adventure than war film, as Johnson channels the sort of deliriously cartoonish aesthetic, weapons and technology of 1940s serials, including lavish set design that would do any James Bond evil mastermind proud. Curiously, Johnson's film works in some surprisingly intense action, (including one of the more unexpectedly gruesome deaths in a comic book film), exploring Captain America's comparatively 'grounded' superhuman abilities to the effect of some of the most gripping fight scenes in recent memory, alternating tightly choreographed beat downs while adding the intriguing new dimension of his ricocheting shield to keep the action nuanced. Between the tidily doled out combat (including unique, visually dynamic showdowns between Nazi-scientist sect Hydra and the US army) and the film's encompassing virtually every form of chase scene (car, foot, submarine, motorcycle, train, helicopter, airplane and even zip-lining), there is ample material to appease any expectations for summer spectacle. \n\nNonetheless, Johnson's film is not, despite its glossy cartoon finish, without its faults. Despite the thundering action, the film may prove too over-the-top for those disinclined to filter through a haze of charming nostalgia. Similarly, throwback cartoonish fun and self-aware irony aside, some viewers may still find it impossible to shake the notion of watching a distasteful two hour army recruitment video. Additionally, like predecessor Thor, the film does lose its footing somewhat as it approaches the climax, and its juggling the emotional demands of a stand-alone narrative while still bridging the transition towards the upcoming superhero epic The Avengers may prove unsettling for non-comic fans. Nonetheless, Johnson admirably reconciles the two, grinding the whiz-bang cheerfulness of his film to a halt with a jarring, quietly tragic ending that, miraculously, proves oddly appropriate in spite of its discordance. Either way, if ever there were a film this year worth sitting out the ending credits, this would be the one. \n\nChris Evans as the iconic \"star-spangled man with the plan\" proves the film's greatest boon. Muting his customary swagger without sacrificing his overflowing charisma, Evans concocts an effortless blend between earnestness and underhanded humour, that makes his transition from good-hearted scrawny loser to unexpected patriotic icon somehow feel incredibly believable, sympathetic and appealing, thus selling the whole film. The fact that Evans can tackle moments such as a \"this is why we fight\" speech, saddled with a nearly absurd CGI- shrunken body, with a straight face and without a false note, and transition to asking his best buddy \"Are you ready to follow Captain America into the jaws of hell?\" with a perfect a quiver of world-weary, witty, self-mockery in his voice, demonstrates a masterfully conscious and nuanced performer delivering his most assured work yet. \n\nHowever, Johnson wisely surrounds Evans with a truly impressive supporting cast, each inhabiting their cheerfully one-note characters with enthusiasm to spare. Hugo Weaving masticates scenery with appropriate preening oiliness as the dastardly Red Skull, and Hayley Atwell and Sebastian Stan inhabit love interest Peggy Carter and best buddy Bucky Barnes with laudable presence and credibility. Tommy Lee Jones has a ball wryly clashing with the film around him as Rogers' military superior, and scene-stealer Stanley Tucci infuses the film with warmth and wit as the scientist behind Rogers' super soldier transformation. Dominic Cooper triumphantly bubbles over with charisma, charm and quirky humour worthy of his superheroic son as master inventor Howard Stark, while Toby Jones slithers with welcome relish as the Red Skull's chief scientist Arnim Zola. \n\nWhile the true make-or-break of the character will depend on his exploration in a contemporary context by Joss Whedon in The Avengers, it is hard to imagine a more appropriate or enjoyable character introduction. Consider Captain America as Indiana Jones' square-jawed uncle ‚Äì bold enough to demonstrate, by example, the role and function of a national icon, yet retrospectively wise enough to stick to its guns and striving for pure entertainment. Such an unabashed dash of fun is worthy of 'recruiting' viewers everywhere. \n\n-9/10",

        "reviewText": "In preparation for its 'Avengers' who assemble next year, Marvel Comics ends the super- heroes showdown this year with its final prequel about the origins of 'Captain America' ‚Äì the leader of the Avengers. Unlike the hi-tech flamboyance of 'Ironman', the might and super power of 'Thor' and the destructive temper of 'The Incredible Hulk', Captain America has little to offer but his devout patriotism and impenetrable shield as a hero. However, what makes him the captain, is the quintessential quality of compassion within the weakling Steve Rogers, that values both strength and power. After shrinking the kids, playing a live board game, recalling dinosaurs and creating werewolves in his movies, director Joe Johnston takes us back to the World War II era when in the midst of the Nazi turmoil, a country sent its troops to war with one hero, who would save the day for America. \n\nThe diminutive Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) never gave up on a fight in the alleys. Being rejected several times by the U.S. Army due to his short and skinny stature was hardly a discouragement. Nothing stopped this patriot from repeated attempts and finally he was enlisted upon the recommendation of a German military scientist (Stanley Tucci). He soon became a part of an experiment that enhanced his strength and capability with a serum that made him the first and last of a new breed of super-heroes. Helpless with just one experimental recruit, Colonel Phillip (Tommy Lee Jones) insists on Steve staying out of war as just one hero would do no good. The tall and muscular Steve now sells war bonds while dancing on stage in various cities as Captain America. After much humiliation and insult, Captain decides to cross enemy lines and play a greater role by overcoming bullies such as the Nazi Red Skull (Hugo Weaving), whose Hydra initiative is aimed at world dominance. \n\nCaptain America's adventure feels like Indiana Jones in its action sequences and at times like a James Bond movie with an ambitious villain who could dominate the world. At times, even the patriotism that is portrayed, can be overwhelming but then, our hero has to justify his name..... The problem here is that Captain America's back story seems to be a mandatory feature needed as a build up to 'The Avengers'. Although its period setting provides a richer backdrop for a super-hero story, one fails to engage deeply with the Captain's motives, emotions and powers. Without his impenetrable Vibranium shield, he is just a stronger human without any powers. Will he be greeted upon his entry in 'The Avengers' with the same fan- fare that Ironman, Hulk and Thor receive? Certainly not. He may have exceptional leadership capabilities through his mild, good-hearted nature but what is a leader without a team? That is what the movie fails to address and ends up being just another super-hero movie. \n\nHugo Weaving's malicious plans of world dominance remind us of many European accented James Bond villains but, with a Hellboy appearance. He has played better roles than this one throughout his career and with a weak plot for world dominance, he has little to dominate on screen no matter how good he can be. Hayley Atwell as Agent Peggy Carter is dismal in her performance. Seldom has an actress portrayed such a straight face that became so forgettable. Tommy Lee Jones is fun to watch because he has the most vivacious character and Stanley Tucci, in his brief appearance is impressionable. Chris Evans is remarkable in his CGI enhanced (?) skinny version where his unfailing ambition is marred by his physical limitations. He is equally smooth in funny moments as he is when he is physically challenged in the Army training. Once he goes through his transition, it's as if he is a different actor altogether. Unaccustomed to his height and strength, it is fun to watch him realize his own potential. As a super-hero in combat, he is just like any other. Straight faced, muscled-up and awesome. \n\nJoe Johnston's Captain America isn't an exceptional movie. It's a good, passable summer movie with loads of patriotism and historic appeal that nurture our hero. The film's concluding minutes will be the one that resonates through the audiences but otherwise, it won't disappoint critics, nor will it draw applause from the fans. In the Marvel world, X-Men still rule supreme but there is a new team lurking around the corner of 2012 and it's led by a strong man with a bullet-proof shield.....\n\n7.818 on a scale of 1-10.",

On the whole, I really did enjoy it, it's action packed, it's well paced, it's fun. There is no ambiguity here at all, it's a case of the good guys versus the bad, Captain America is a wholesome, kind and brave American, Schmidt is a fairly basic, scheming villain, Hugo Weaving makes him interesting though.\n\nI rate Chris Evans, I'm a big fan of his, and I did very much like the way he played the part, there was a degree of humility, a whole lot of sincerity.\n\nSome nice special effects, and plenty of action scenes. I loved the production values, especially the way they recreated a war torn Britain.\n\nI really appreciated the wry humour, and of course enjoyed the story of the little guy overcoming adversity to save the world.\n\nFirst one down, I really rather enjoyed that, considering where this sits in the Marvel world, I thought it was good, 7/10.",

Tommy Lee Jones plays an excellent Colonel. Meanwhile evil Nazi Hugo Weaving believing he is Darth Maul, has his own plans for world conquest using sharks with frickin' laser beams. (Just kidding about the sharks.) Rogers is a 90 pound weakling who displays intellect, courage, and guts. He is selected for the military's secret program and is transformed into a muscular super hero. The special effects were very good, although we do know from \"Last Action Hero\" you can't really jump around car roofs. After Rogers is transformed he becomes Captain America to be used as a recruiting tool, as Tommy Lee still has his doubts about the 90 pound weakling.\n\nOf course things change and the rest of the story shouldn't be too hard to figure out, even if you don't read comics. Now the very end utilizes the one-eyed Samuel L. Jackson from Iron Man 2 which hints at an ultimate sequel providing everyone isn't dead by then.\n\nThe movie combines action, drama, light comedy, and light romance. Good acting, good dialogue, good frickin' laser beams.\n\nNo swearing, nudity, or sex.",

It's the best big budget movie that I've seen this year. It hits a high standard of excellence by combining a cool plot, breathtaking action sequences, a heavy dose of self discovery and realization, charisma, a dash of patriotism, love and puts it all together in one amazing package. This movie will surprise a lot of people with its heart while sacrificing none of the fun. The inner turmoil worked well, the beautiful thing is that we can relate to each character, especially that of underdog Steve Rogers. His never say die attitude and heart of a champion makes this hero more interesting then most. Captain America delivers on every level and does so with great emotional moments and it's a movie that lives up to all the hype it has generated.\n\nEverything has converged perfectly, delivering what is now the best summer movie season in recent memory. It's certainly the best overall summer for superheroes. The cast is obviously stellar but that doesn't always mean greatness. (American Gangster, Wanted, Sphere, etc.) I'm happy to say this amazing cast delivers in every way. Believe it or not, Chris Evans himself delivers one of the greatest performances in a comic adaptation film EVER. Maybe it's because the character itself is one of the most complex and intriguing that any genre has to offer but that doesn't diminish just what a home run Evans has hit. They took the character seriously but still remembered to include fun and humor. I almost can't convey how much I enjoyed this film.",

        "reviewText": "With the imminent \"Avengers\" movie coming next year, only one hero's origin story remains untold¬Öuntil now. Falling in line with \"Thor,\" \"Iron Man,\" and \"The Incredible Hulk,\" \"Captain America\" showcases the rise of Steve Rogers as the title character. Unlike the other films, which take place in modern times, this one goes way back to WWII, showing the Captain kicking Nazi butt! With a lot of \"Wolfenstein\" style occult mystique and a slight \"Indiana Jones\" sense of adventure, this movie has a number of solid action sequences, and plenty of imaginative special effects and setpieces. With its references to various characters and concepts of other Mavel movies, it fits into the franchise really well. It might take some stretch of the imagination to believe that Nazis could be this futuristic, but for a superhero movie, it's all good fun.\n\nThe story in this case is pretty solid. The main character shows strong development, and for most of the movie, you really root for him. There's nothing more thrilling than watching the underdog getting the upper hand. As it goes on, much of the character drama and story development gets pushed aside by the action, but it still works. By the end, voila, we have the lead-in for the \"Avengers\" film.\n\nIf there's any complaint for this film, it's that there could have been more. Whether it needs a stronger action setpiece or a more invoking sense of drama, I'm not sure, but something seems missing, and nothing really makes this film stand over any of the other superhero films that have come out so far.\n\nThe film is competently made, with decent (but never exceptional) photography. Editing is good for the most part, but I am not a fan of the montage in the middle of the film that makes the entire war campaign whiz by. A couple of action scenes seemed a little sloppily-edited, but it's hardly noticeable. Acting is swell; Chris Evans is surprisingly strong as the main character, and I enjoyed Hayley Atwell, Sebastian Stan, Tommy Lee Jones, Stanley Tucci, and Hugo Weaving in their roles. Writing seems pretty good. Production value is high, featuring lots of good (if not overly-slick) sets, props, costumes and special effects. Music is appropriately upbeat and adventurous. In the end, I'd say the film met my expectations, but never fully exceeded them. But it, along with an all-too-short sneak preview after the credits, provide the necessary bridge to the \"Avengers\" film.\n\nRecommended.\n\n4/5 (entertainment: 4/5, story: 4/5, film: 4/5)",

        "reviewText": "Yes, another high-production, superhero movie invades the theatres. Should you watch it?\n\nCaptain America: The First Avenger is an action-adventure movie that shows us the transformation of one Steve Rogers from a scrawny but patriotic man during World War II to Captain America, the star-spangled icon of freedom. Equipped with the Super-Soldier serum and his desire to do good, he finds the strength to combat Hydra, a Nazi offshoot, and its deranged leader, Johann Schmidt.\n\nTo a great extent, the First Avenger succeeds in translating the essence of its title character to the big screen. Captain America is portrayed as a humble guy who just wants to serve his country, so much so that he goes to great lengths to do it. Although there are minor changes to his comic book origin, who Captain America is is preserved. Steve Rogers may have said that he's \"just a kid from Brooklyn,\" but he is definitely so much more than that. He is the hero whom people look up to, and whom superheroes aspire to be. Captain America may not have the coolest powers but is relatable in so many levels.\n\nIt is becoming a trend in movies today to have a complicated plot in order to tell a good story. However, the First Avenger's approach, which centers on Captain America fighting the good fight, is pretty straightforward. The film proves that you don't need gazillion mind-boggling things to tell an inspiring tale of an extraordinary soldier on the frontlines. Being a superhero movie set in a war zone, it offers a healthy dose of action and involves Captain America bashing enemy heads and throwing his signature shield more times than you can count. Scenes of romance and humor help the film to become balanced and entertaining to watch. Steve is also a nice break from the morally conflicted heroes we usually encounter. He is simply someone who is moved to do what is right‚Äînothing more, nothing less.\n\nAside from the excellent character development and story progression, the film also boasts a solid cast. I honestly had doubts about Chris Evans playing the captain because he was such a fit for the cocky yet strong-willed Johnny Storm aka the Human Torch in the Fantastic Four movies, but he gives a convincing performance. Hugo Weaving as the menace Red Skull doesn't disappoint either, although we are still sure to remember him best as Agent Smith in the Matrix trilogy. Hayley Atwell's portrayal of Peggy Carter has a sense of both hardiness and elegance which makes the character easy to love. \n\nAs someone who consistently follows Captain America's exploits in comic books, my admiration for the character has increased even more because of the First Avenger. The film gives fans everywhere a good show. I especially liked that they were able to incorporate the printing of a Captain America comic book in a world where he really exists. The punching of \"Hitler\" in the face never gets old!\n\nDuring the course of Captain America: The First Avenger, viewers are shown how to be a patriot through Cap's positive demeanor and outlook. In the end, we come to realize that the film deals with fighting for the things we love ‚Äì freedom, country, friend and even one's own potential to do great things. The ending of the film may have been a bit abrupt, but it definitely points to a sequel. In this case, The Avengers (2012) is just around the corner, and it is something that we should watch if we want more of our Captain America.\n\nYes, another high-production, superhero movie invades the theatres. Should you watch it?\n\nOf course. There is no other option.",

        "reviewText": "\"Rocketeer\" director Joe Johnston's \"Captain America\" amounts to a timeless David versus Goliath tale set in the Marvel Comics' universe where good always trumps evil. Unlike \"Thor\" and \"Green Lantern,\" \"Captain America\" ranks as a thoroughly spectacular but larger-than-life extravaganza with a genuinely charismatic hero struggling against a marvelously malignant villain. Chris Evans' engaging performance as the 'First Avenger' is something else, too! If you recall, Evans had the time of his life several years ago playing egotistical Johnny Storm, aka 'the Human Torch,' in the two \"Fantastic Four\" flicks. Make no mistake; Evans is nothing like he was in those two super heroic sagas. Indeed, \"Captain America\" boasts some amazing special effects, but its best special effect is the sincerity that Evans brings to the role of Steve Rogers. Whether he plays Rogers as either a scrawny, 98-pound zero or a brawny, fleet-footed hero, Evans imparts heart to this $140-million thriller. During the first half of \"Captain America,\" Johnston gradually builds the momentum to let us grow accustomed to Evans as a scrappy little fellow who suffers the wrath of bullies. This pathetic weakling refuses to let anybody keep him down, and it's fun because Evans makes it look so authentic despite the obvious CGI effects. Hugo Weaving registers as the ideal villain who holds the upper hand throughout most of the supercharged shenanigans. Tommy Lee Jones and Hayley Atwell co-star respectively as Captain America's superior and his love interest.\n\n\"Captain America\" opens in the present before it reverts to the past. Typically, movies with contemporary openings and endings sacrifice any sense of suspense. After all, you know if the characters thrive in the present that they must not have suffered in the past. Basically, this constitutes nothing more than a narrative cinematic convention. The chief difference here is that we're only given a glimpse of Captain America's legendary star-spangled shield instead of the eponymous protagonist himself. Anyway, the film unfolds in the frozen wasteland of the Arctic Circle as a Russian oil expedition stumbles onto something buried in the ice. They contact the Americans who slice into the ice with a laser, find a commodious craft of unknown origin, and uncover a circular red, white, and blue shield with a star. The scene shifts to March 1942 as despicable Nazi officer Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving of \"The Matrix\") and his men storm into T√∏nsberg, Norway, and confiscate an enigmatic tesseract. Essentially, this is a magical cube boasting incalculable power. Supposedly, the tesseract was a fabulous jeweled artifact that belonged to the legendary Norse god Odin. Once anybody lays their eyes on it, they are no longer the same. Meanwhile, in New York City, the U.S. military brands Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) unfit for duty owing to a myriad of health problems. The resilient Rogers tries to enlist again when his buddy James Buchanan 'Bucky' Barnes (Sebastian Stan of \"Black Swan\") takes him to a showcase of futuristic technologies. Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci of \"Easy A\") eavesdrops on Rogers' conversation with Barnes about his desperate need to get into combat. Suitably impressed by Rogers' attitude, Erskine allows him to enlist. Moreover, Erskine recruits Rogers as part of a \"super-soldier\" experiment under the aegis of Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones of \"Coal Miner's Daughter\") and Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell of \"The Duchess\"). Phillips displays considerable skepticism about Erskine's contention that Rogers qualifies as the ideal candidate for the procedure. One day during a training exercise, Phillips lobs a grenade among the recruits. Everybody but Rogers scrambles for cover, while he smothers the grenade with his frail body. Predictably, the grenade is a dummy, but Rogers' act of self-sacrificing bravery convinces the colonel that he is the appropriate choice. \n\nNo sooner has Rogers emerged from the procedure as an entirely new man with a buffed up body than a Nazi saboteur steps in and kills Erskine. As it turns out, Erskine keep no notes except those in his head. After Erskine dies, Rogers experiences his new-found strength and captures the saboteur. The saboteur lives long enough to warn Rogers that he has to face more of his kind before he crunches on a cyanide capsule and croaks. Roger wins fame and acclaim across the country, but he suffers a setback because he is the first and only of his kind. Colonel Phillips reassigns him and Roger ends up at War Bond rallies where he acts like a cheerleader surrounded by dancing girls. Eventually, when our hero learns that his best friend has been caught, he disobeys orders and leads an inspirational rescue behind enemy lines. Now that Rogers has proved himself, he must face the Red Skull. The Red Skull is Nazi officer Johann Schmidt and he is so ambitious that he not only wants to crush America but also Adolf Hitler. Talk about a villain to end all villains! Anybody who has read the reprints of the World War 2 era \"Captain America\" comic book should be thrilled with the way that \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" scenarists Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have handled the original material by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby. Of course, Johnston and his scribes have ratcheted up the hardware for the big transformation scene that turns Steve Rodgers into Captain America. \n\nAltogether, \"Captain America\" is a predictable but entertaining comic book movie with sensational special effects and a sympathetic hero. If you are a Marvel Comic fan, you should stick around after the lengthy end credits for a glimpse of the forthcoming \"Avengers\" film due for release in May 2012.",

Captain America has had 3 movies in the past, not counting some 1940s ones which can be excused for being good, that were so awful they make movies like Steel or Green Lantern look good. However, I saw a lot of critiques for this movie that were negative. Now I understand differing opinions and all, but they all followed a formula and each one seemed like griping to the point it was just getting stupid. If you'll indulge me here, I have a list of the repeated ones and a rebuttal to each.\n\n1. The technology for WWII is too far advanced! This one was the most common and the stupidest in my opinion. It's called \"Fiction\", as in \"not real\". Every time I heard this one it made me think these people have no suspension of disbelief and would complain that Iron Man is a terrible movie because the technology to build a flying robot suit doesn't exist yet. People, it's comic books and it's in a fictional WWII setting. It's allowed to take liberties.\n\n2. Captain America is too invincible! That was just stupid. Captain America is relatively weak compared to many other superheroes, he's just a perfect example of a human being brought about by the experiments in the film. Also, he's the main character. He's not supposed to die in a movie that is leading him up to be in a tie-in to all the other recent Marvel films that will lead to The Avengers.\n\n3. Red Skull is a terrible villain.\n\nThere is no sense to this one. He's supposed to be the guy that's worse than Hitler and can get just as many people on his side to do his bidding. On top of that he can take Cap in a fight fairly evenly. Saying he's a bad villain is baseless.\n\n4. Steve doesn't go through a character arc/get any back-story.\n\nFor one, he really doesn't need to. Steve was a good guy from the start, and he did go through an arc. It was subtle, but he did. He gained more confidence and become the soldier he is. He has a back-story but it's weaved in throughout. We know he was bullied a lot, we know he he is from a military family, we know he grew up with Bucky, we know he has had very few, if any, dates in his life, he's a childhood friend of Bucky, and we know he wants to be a soldier because he feels its his duty. I'd rather get it weaved in through the narrative of the story rather than get a huge text dump or just have characters talking for half an hour about everything they've ever done.\n\n5. This movie just glorifies America! Not really. It's a good vs. evil story that happens to have a character named Captain America, which was given to him by a publicity stunt. I suppose you also hate movies like Saving Private Ryan because it tells things from the perspective of American soldiers but not the Japanese ones? \n\nThese were the most common arguments and they are easily refutable. Captain America is a great movie, showcasing one of the best Marvel has to offer and should be in the 7s or higher, not the 6s.",

This is not because the character has any less depth than other super-heroes, but I knew that it would be extremely difficult to transition Steve Rogers to film in a serviceable way. The guy is called \"Captain America\" for heaven's sake.\n\nAny comic-book reader would probably appreciate the ironies and idiosyncrasies behind such ostentatiously patriotic code-name, mostly because in print Cap has challenged the assumptions behind his symbolism, becoming a more conflicted and universal figure.\n\nBut its hard to translate any of this idiosyncrasy successfully in 2 hours. Fortunately the film, instead of getting to political, is more old-fashioned pulp like Indy or \"Sky Captain,\" which thankfully never takes itself too seriously (which was one of the flaws of \"Thor\").\n\nI had my doubts that Chris Evans could pull off the modesty and heart needed for the role, but I was wrong. As the Red Skull, Hugo Weaving was wonderfully evil in a nostalgic, serial-villain kind of way. Haley Atwell is a sidekick/love-interest with the rare quality of not being incredibly annoying, and Tommy Lee Jones is perfectly cast as Tommy Lee Jones.\n\nThe reason I found this to be a good movie was because I enjoyed it, plain and simple. It's well-photographed and well-acted. Like its titular hero, it modestly embraced its silliness, creating a charming B-movie experience.",

        "reviewText": "The last of Marvel Comics' superheroes to make its big screen debut before next year's hotly anticipated 'The Avengers' was also the first to debut on print some 70 years ago in Joe Simon and Jack Kirby's Super Soldier series. Captain America was his name, his appearance at the time when the world was in the throes of World War II- though it would be months later before America finally decided to join in the fight following the bombing of Pearl Harbour.\n\nYou'd understand why then the character was created as a square-jawed, well-chiselled, honourable man with almost zero flaws- the world needed a hero in the truest sense of the word and Captain America fit that profile to a T. In adapting the comic character, writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (of the 'Narnia' franchise) have wisely opted not to distort the wholesome hero Captain America has been known to be, and this is precisely why their film stands out tall and strong against the plethora of superhero flicks in recent years.\n\nIndeed, moral ambiguity has become de rigueur for the modern-day superhero since the likes of 'The Dark Knight', so much so that the simplicity of old-fashioned true-blue heroism is in fact quite refreshing. And other than his physical build, Steve Rogers is no less than the perfect hero- his only wish is to enlist in the war to do his part for his nation, and he's not afraid to fight back even when faced with an opponent bigger and stronger than he is. Rogers is finally granted his wish- after numerous unsuccessful interviews- when he meets German defector Dr. Abraham Erskine (the excellent Stanley Tucci), who recruits him as part of the US Army's plan to create super-soldiers.\n\nNeedless to say, Rogers is eventually chosen among the candidates- the choice, as Dr Erskine explains to him, is because 'a strong man who has known power all his life may lose respect for that power; but a weak man knows the value of strength and knows compassion'. An agonising serum injection later, Rogers is transformed into the buff and muscular Captain America- his newfound powers quickly put to the test when he sets off down the streets of Manhattan barefoot in hot pursuit of a German spy who assassinates Dr Erskine just minutes after the experiment.\n\nThat spy is in fact under the service of renegade officer Johann Schmidt (The Matrix's Hugo Weaving in another expert villain role), the leader of the Nazis' occult research arm HYDRA building his own personal army for world domination. Schmidt is a fine nemesis to Captain America, the very antithesis of the latter's red-white-and-blue goodness and very definition of the word 'evil'. If the film draws Captain America as the equivalent of pure heroism, then so must it also paint Schmidt as the equivalent of complete evil.\n\nBut before the two go up against each other, Captain America must first overcome the politics of war, as he is quickly placed in a blue costume and made to perform on stage as an All-American hero to urge the public to buy war bonds and hence raise money for the war effort. Director Joe Johnston has plenty of satirical fun playing up the overt patriotism of these acts, presenting them in a montage that sees Captain America perform across different states but with the same act which includes a fake German Nazi. This detour into media celebrity also sees the film at its most grounded, as Captain America becomes a larger-than-life symbol used as a morale booster for the public.\n\nHe finally springs into action when he learns that his buddy Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) has been taken prisoner by HYDRA, and despite warnings from his former commanding officer, Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones), decides to go deep into enemy territory to rescue him and other prisoners-of-war. It is there he realises the extent of Schmidt's nefarious plans, the rest of the movie a non-stop thrill-ride as Captain America assembles his army to clean out Schmidt's bases one by one leading up to that final confrontation between the two.\n\nYes, it takes an hour before the action kicks in proper, but Johnston makes the wait absolutely worth it. Johnston has demonstrated his penchant for visual effects, and his abilities are plainly evident in the film's action set-pieces- beginning with a daring raid to rescue the POWs, followed by a sneak attack on Schmidt on board a moving train, and culminating in a climactic showdown set inside Schmidt's underground lair as well as around and in his fighter jet. There is unadulterated exhilaration to be had here, and the film's infectiously jaunty spirit adds immensely to the sheer enjoyment.\n\nOf course given the period setting, there is a need to bring our hero to the present to join with the other members of S.H.I.E.L.D. including their team leader Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson in yet another cameo)- but kudos to both the screen writing team of Markus and McFeely as well as director Johnston for keeping this adaptation true to the old pop culture motif that Captain America was. Whereas modern-day superheroes tend to be less clearly defined in terms of black and white or should we say good and evil, this old-school hero is a perfect nostalgic emblem of heroism. That and the fact that this movie is also mighty entertaining is just the perfect finish to this summer's superhero bombast, and a run-up par excellence to next summer's 'The Avengers'.\n\n\n* www.moviexclusive.com\n",

        "reviewText": "Hard to believe that just three years ago (2008), Marvel made the bold decision to create a single movie universe out of their second-tier heroes (though some may argue that Iron Man is first-tier; IMO, that honor really belongs to Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four...but that's an argument for another time) that would allow them to finally bring The Avengers to the big screen. This plan got off to a hugely successful start with 2008's IRON MAN (9/10) and a decent reboot of THE INCREDIBLE HULK (7/10) later that same year, and started picking up steam when 2010's IRON MAN 2 (8/10) brought War Machine and Black Widow into the picture. This year, THOR (7/10) ushered in a good start to the summer movie season and introduced the malevolently mischievous Loki to the mix while giving us a sneak peek at Hawkeye. Now, Captain America finally gets his chance to shine. How does he do?\n\nRejoice, Marvelites, for Marvel Studios has done it again...taken a hero whose origins would be difficult to get right on film and managed to make it look easy. Chris Evans, whose first foray into Marvel movies was playing Johnny Storm (the Human Torch) in the merely O.K. FANTASTIC FOUR, is amazing as Steve Rogers, the 90-lb. weakling who gets transformed into a Super Soldier and becomes the much-beloved Captain America. Evans never lets us forget that Cap's real strength has always been his good heart and his love for his country, and that overarching goodness and patriotism are perfectly blended together in this pastiche of 40's nostalgia mixed with WWII heroism and just a touch of steampunk (relax, it works here).\n\nThe plot, if you've read any reviews, you already know, so I won't rehash it here. Instead, I'll touch on how much I really enjoyed every moment in this movie; the scenes are perfectly put together, all the set pieces move the action forward (even the cheesy USO show montage), and the pace never drags, even in the slower, more personal sections. I do wish a little more work had gone into making the villainous Red Skull (the always-great Hugo Weaving, who could make reading a phonebook interesting) a more compelling villain to watch; yes, Weaving does great work with what he's been given, but he could have been so much better. HYDRA never really feels like a true threat because of the way Cap and his men handle them so easily, and that's too bad, because a real menacing presence is the one thing this movie really needed to go beyond \"Entertaining\".\n\nThe supporting players, though, all do great work in making this universe feel real and alive. Hayley Atwell as British Intelligence Agent Peggy Carter, Cap's budding love interest, is great, and their interactions are surprisingly touching. Dominic Cooper plays millionaire inventor Howard Stark with a mixture of charm and intensity (and more than a little touch of Robert Downey Jr.'s mannerisms--watch for the moment when Stark peers over the top of his glasses in a very Downey-esque manner) that provides a nice foreshadowing of his importance in later Marvel lore (as a founder of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the father of Iron Man Tony Stark)--plus seeing an early version of Stark Industries' logo on every piece of tech is too cool for words. Tommy Lee Jones was born to play an Army hard-nose, and he doesn't disappoint as Rogers' commanding officer Colonel Chester Phillips.\n\nThe movie, though, ultimately hinges on Evans' ability to pull off the earnestly intense Captain America, and he does it brilliantly. Even the moment where Cap makes what he believes will be the Ultimate Sacrifice (and if you know your Captain America lore, you know EXACTLY what that sacrifice is and how he's going to do it) never becomes cheesy or overdone; when Cap's voice vanishes from the radio, I cried. Stick around for the post-credits tease, where we FINALLY get our first look at THE AVENGERS (due in 2012); it's well worth it.,",

        "reviewText": "As there's something about the the 1930s-1940s that appeals to me, I tend to prefer movies set in the era and made in its cinematic style. And being fond of the adventure genre, I anticipate movies like the Indiana Jones trilogy, \"The Rocketeer\", \"Sky Captain And the World of Tomorrow\", \"The Mummy\" (1999) and, of course, \"Captain America\".\n\nWhen I first heard about this movie, my expectations soared. The director was Joe Johnston, who made my favorite superhero movie, \"The Rocketeer\". It was set during WWII, made in a 1940s style, and scored by Alan Silvestri. Alas, my heart sank after I found out that they were going to do the whole frozen alive storyline I've always hated. But, I reasoned, the only reason they are making it is because of \"The Avengers\". Without that storyline, they wouldn't even be making it. Beggars can't be choosers.\n\nWell, after two years of waiting, I got to see the movie. And to my surprise, it surpassed my high expectations. I didn't even hate the ending, although I would have much preferred a happier one more in line with the original 1940s comics (in which Cap stays in his own era, then fights commies in the 1950s). So, here are my thoughts on the movie.\n\nActing.\n\nChris Evans was great as Captain America. He nailed the character. After watching him as Captain America, I can't see anyone else in the role. The special effects performed on him to make him look skinny for the first part of the movie were absolutely seamless. If I hadn't known about them, I wouldn't have been able to tell they were there. But those effects would not have looked nearly so great if it had not been for Evans convincingly \"acting skinny\". No matter what condition Steve Rogers is in, shrimp or super soldier, Chris Evans portrayed him flawlessly.\n\nIt was refreshing to see a non-angsty, pure-hearted hero for the first time in a while. Instead of portraying Cap with irony or satire, they took him seriously, and it really payed off. Cap, despite (or because of) his delightful simplicity and earnestness, comes across as incredibly deep and human, proving once again that the notion of the old-fashioned hero being inferior to his modern antihero counterpart is merely a haughty assumption.\n\nHugo Weaving's Red Skull was effectively menacing, darkly humorous, and overall deliciously like an old-fashioned serial villain. Haley Atwell was charming, feisty and classically beautiful as Peggy Carter. Stanley Tucci's Dr. Erskine was played to perfection, Tommy Lee Jones was a scene-stealer of the highest order, Toby Jones was very memorable as a sympathetic, almost lovable Arnim Zola, Richard Armitage was effectively despicable, Dominic Cooper was good as Howard Stark, and Neal McDonough made his presence known despite very little screen time. Sebastion Stan was also quite good as Bucky, although he wasn't quite as memorable as many of the others.\n\nVisuals and Action.\n\nMy feelings on the visuals are mixed. I was hoping for a bit more of a photo-realistic feel, but it instead looks a bit too much like \"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\" (a movie whose visuals I like very much, but would prefer to be a novelty, not the norm). That said, the use of wide lenses did help make it look more real than many other movies with such massive amounts of CGI. The color in many scenes is quite good, or at least by today's standards. I did dislike the muted color used in some of the winter scenes, though. I wish they had gone for more of a Technicolor look, but I'm pretty satisfied with the look of the movie, except for the winter scenes.\n\nI didn't like the action montage too much, as it had some slow-motion effects, as well as giving off a feeling that you're being cheated out of some scenes. I also thought that the motorcycle-chase felt somewhat rushed. Other than that, however, I did like most of the action scenes. The Kruger chase, Cap's first mission, and the final fight with Red Skull were standouts.\n\nI would have preferred that the HYDRA soldiers' uniforms look a bit more Nazi-like, but the look they have works well. Red Skull doesn't care about them as individuals. He is the Hydra, and they are merely his many identical heads. Thus, their faceless, almost robotic look works very well. \n\nMusic.\n\nSilvestri's score is the best superhero score in years. His main theme unfortunately doesn't have the \"flow\" that some of his better works do, and seems a little clunky at first. But after you hear it a few times, it grows on you. It's now stuck in my head. Overall, Silvestri's score hits all the right notes, and captures menace, adventure, and every other mood required of it, while having actual themes. Media Ventures, eat your collective heart out.\n\nWriting.\n\nThe humor was great throughout. The levels of \"heart\" were set to maximum. The romance, although sparse, was memorable. Everything was portrayed swiftly, without padding, The plot was very well thought out. Memorable lines and scenes abound. Overall, the writing was excellent. Some things that I particularly liked were Steve's journey from shrimp to super-soldier, the USO scene, Cap's first mission, the role-reversal with Bucky, and the romance. I also liked how Red Skull was his own boss. It gave him more menace. Plus, using HYDRA ironically makes it feel more historically accurate. Having Captain America defeat the Nazis would mess with history too much, and having him lose to them just wouldn't do. All I really disliked were Bucky's death and Captain America getting frozen alive. That could work well in some movies, but a 1940s-style adventure of this sort just cries out for a happy ending. Plus, the modern-day bookends detract from the overall atmosphere. Still, the final scenes were poignant, although out-of-place.\n\n9/10.",

        "reviewText": "This summer of 2011 has certainly been a summer for super-hero movies, with the one I have been least looking forward to coming last. And, if not the best, it is as good as the best. In fact, my only real reservation derives from the fact that Captain America has never been a character which does very much for me (and, even after the movie, which I enjoyed immensely, he still doesn't).\n\nThe story is familiar to comic fans - weedy Steve Rogers is transformed by a super serum into enhanced Captain America, who pursues super-Nazi the Red Skull.\n\nI very much liked the period setting, which gave this film a feel which is quite different to the other super-hero movies (even the 60s-based X-Men: First Class felt fairly contemporary), and all the principals gave excellent performances.. The action and effects all worked well (particularly the transformation of Chris Evans into the scrawny pre-serum Steve Rogers), and I suspect that there were lots of nice touches which meant a lot to those more familiar with the comics mythology of Cap than I am (I got a flavour from time to time that others might know who so-and-so was, but I didn't).\n\nAs well as the big picture, there were lots of small touches I liked - the early incarnations of the shield, the use of the first comics costume, the establishment of Steve Rogers as a bona fide hero even when he was a skinny weed, for instance. But the thing I liked most about this film (and, to some extent, it contrasts with many other super-hero movies) is the fact that much of what happened in this film really mattered, both on a big scale and also on a more intimate level. Joe Johnston did a very good job in making every element of this film work together.\n\nI am looking forward to seeing the The Avengers next year, and I hope Joss Whedon does as good a job as Johnston.",

        "reviewText": "I've never followed Captain America in comics though I do know a little bit of the origin. So I'm one of the people who could sit back and enjoy the movie for what it was rather than nitpick on gaps in the CA lore.\n\nThe best thing about the movie is what's not in it- and that's cheap advertising gimmicks, such as a character opening a laptop to show an Apple or Sony logo, or car symbols or Coke, Pepsi or any fast food restaurant. It, however, would have been interesting to see if they could tie CA into their food products by having Marvel burgers or the American Superburger...I dislike cheap advertising tricks and thankfully this was completely avoided. Gone also was any chance of using high tech gadgets much like what was shown in Iron Man 2.\n\nI found the plot interesting- the buildup to Steve Rogers becoming Captain American was done well and very interesting. The downside would be the action sequences which I thought would be more realistic or appropriate to the time setting. Instead several sequences were more reminiscent of what Iron Man 2 felt like.\n\nAs I'm not a CA follower some of the historical nods to certain symbols or the side characters themselves were lost to me but I did enjoy that Howard Stark's character was in the movie as it introduced the origin of Stark Industries and it's technologies of the future.\n\nActingwise Chris Evans did a surprisingly good job. In Fantastic Four he was OTT and hammed a lot and was generally quite annoying. Here he's more serious, focused and determined. There were a lot less quips, something I really detest in American made super hero movies. The cheesy quips might work in graphic novels or comics but in movies it comes off as plain lame. Hugo Weaving was quite good though too- he's becoming quite popular in characters taken from literature, comics or cartoons.\n\nThis is a movie for pretty much every age gap. There are no swear words (I don't even think the word damn makes it into the movie!) and no sex scenes so kids are perfectly fine to watch it. It's definitely the best superhero movie of the year and one of the better ones made entirely. I doubt that any sequel will be as good in terms of plot and story setting but in the meantime enjoy this summer gem.",

        "reviewText": "I'm not fan of Iron Man, but really enjoyed the movie Thor, so I wasn't sure what I'd make of this movie. After the opening scene (which made me wonder if I was watching the wrong film), we cut to the 1940s during WW2. It's this change of scenery/time period that gives the film a different sort of tone/flavor, thus making it stand out from the crowd. It's like a good old-fashioned action adventure movie (which should be no surprise given it's from Joe Johnston, who directed The Rocketeer).\n\nAnother large part of what makes this film successful is its cast. To any who doubted Chris Evans, he more than proves himself as Steve Rogers. Thanks to impressive computer-aided trickery, we meet Steve as a scrawny \"90 pound asthmatic\", who has a never-give-up attitude, but sadly nobody takes seriously when he wants to help fight the war. After befriending a kind scientist, Steve gets to be the first test subject in a planned long line of super soldiers. His transformation into the epitome of physical perfection is quite the sight to behold, as we see Scrawny Evans turned into Steamy Evans, who's a muscle-bound man with enhanced abilities and doesn't have a robotic suit doing all the work for him. What's important to note, though, is that what makes Steve a hero isn't the abilities he gains, but who he was *before* the transformation. It's just that now he's finally allowed to be the best that he truly can be in physicality to match his hero's heart.\n\nI really appreciated that he wasn't yet another wise-cracking smart-ar$e, as a lot of 'heroes' seem to be nowadays, which makes him easily likable, and it's this endearing quality which catches the eye of Agent Peggy Carter, played by the stunning Hayley Atwell, who I have no problem saying is officially my hero. Peggy is the perfect woman, as she's got it all (brains, beauty and bada$$edness). Atwell plays her to perfection and Peggy is easily my favourite female lead in a comic book movie. There's a sweet relationship between Peggy and Steve that develops throughout the film and it's clear that she admires/cares for him not because of the way he (now) looks, but because of who he *is* as a person, his intelligence and selflessness. Evans and Atwell have excellent chemistry/play well off each other and are my favourite comic book movie couple.\n\nOther characters in the film include Tommy Lee Jones, as the gruff Colonel Phillips, who's a bit rough around the edges, but manages to show that he's not entirely without heart. Stanley Tucci is excellent as the doctor who sees the potential in Steve others don't. A real friendship develops between the two, and it goes a long way to making sure that when Dr. Erskine exits the film, we feel what Steve feels. This isn't the only important/meaningful friendship in the film, though. Sebastian Stan plays another likable character as Steve's best friend, Bucky, Their dynamic feels very real/believable, as Bucky is one of the few to stand up for Steve.\n\nLastly, Hugo Weaving does some major scenery-chewing in the role of Johann Schmidt. Not everything goes according to plan for the crazy Nazi dude obsessed with becoming a god (when will these bad guys in comic book films learn NOT to experiment on themselves?), and he winds up becoming a disfigured red-skulled villain. I actually liked how the reveal of Red Skull was approached, with only very vague hints to what was lurking underneath the surface early in the film (like when he's standing in shadow, posing for his portrait, with copious amounts of red paint having been used to indicate something's not right). Once we do finally see him in his full Red Skull glory, this is when Weaving seems to really cut loose with the role and we're treated to a memorable montage. He's supported by Toby Jones as Dr. Arnim Zola, the 'Smithers' to Weaving's 'Mr. Burns' (there's even a sequence where Red Skull has an escape ship and Zola's wondering where he's going to sit, to which Red Skull basically replies that he likes to put his feet up. Okay, not exactly the same as that, but I noticed the similarity).\n\nThe film has several standout action sequences that are imaginative and offer us something different to your typical explosions/gunfire, though one scene that I particularly enjoyed wasn't action-based at all. Before Captain America's even gotten a proper costume, he's stuck in tights with little wings jutting out from the sides of his cowl (all those who complained about the updated Captain America costume need only see this nod to the original version to realise that changes did indeed need to be made), but what makes this scene so memorable is the fact that we're treated to a performance of the supremely catchy 'Star-Spangled Man' whilst Captain America travels around the country to boost morale, promoting war bonds. It's a delightful surprise/stand-out sequence in the movie.\n\nThankfully, Cap eventually gets upgraded to much more practical star-spangled duds (which I saw described as resembling 'a tricked-out airman's jumpsuit, complete with a mask which looks to be adapted from a WW2 helmet' and he also acquires a handy shield which doubles as a kick-ar$e Frisbee, which he performs some impressive shield-fu with. The only slight negative I found with this film was the ending, which stinks of being merely set-up for The Avengers (of which there is yet more set up for, plus a teaser trailer of, at the end of the film's credits) instead of the film feeling like it gets its own proper satisfying ending (much like Thor did). Sadly, the blossoming relationship between Steve & Peggy is cruelly cut short (their goodbye scene is emotional/very effective). Aside from the opening and closing scenes, I enjoyed this film immensely and found it to be a rollicking good time with a lot of heart to it, thus making it my favourite MCU film.",

        "reviewText": "As just a kid from Brooklyn, Captain America makes a name for himself in this extremely entertaining and engaging superhero flick. Like Superman, Captain America is Marvel Comics answer to the Red, White, and Blue, and while this movie could have been a simple set up to Marvel's The Avengers, it manages to be its own movie. Part of this is because it takes place first in the timeline of all of the Marvel Studios' movies, so there are fewer references to the other heroes who come later down the line, but this movie also focuses on showing the transformation of Steve Rogers, from scrawny kid getting beat up in the alleys of Brooklyn, to the symbol of hope for America in World War II.\n\nThe movie is almost entirely set in the 1940s, featuring the Greatest Generation in all of its glory, with this movie somewhat playing as a love letter to that simpler time where evil was evil, and good was good. When a small fry guy named Steve Rogers gets rejected five different times to be enlisted in the Army, he gets a lucky shot from a military scientist, Dr. Erskine, who tests an experimental super soldier formula on Rogers, and voila! We now have a superhero. But it takes more than muscles to be a true hero, and even though Rogers managed to impress Erskine with his compassion, fortitude, and morals, he must do the same for the big guns at the military if he wants to see actual action aside from being a part of song and dance numbers and movie serials to sell war bonds.\n\nDirector Joe Johnston plays around with the 1940s setting, with the whole movie filmed in sepia tones evoking the look of the pop culture from the period. The story plays like one long Saturday matin√©e serial, filled with tons of pulp and improbable science fiction, but those were stalwarts of the adventure stories of the time. What Johnston does best though, is mastering Rogers' journey from zero to hero. As Captain America, Steve Rogers uses his compassion, fortitude, and morals, to do near impossible missions, as is seen in a scene where Rogers saves over 400 prisoners of war all on his own, proving to the Army that he should be on the front line of the war effort and not helping with morale back home. Throughout the whole movie, Rogers bonds with an American agent named Peggy Carter, winning her heart through the same inner heroism that made him Captain America. Carter is a pin up girl in looks, but a girl who can show up the boys in attitude. Add on to this all, a great maniacal villain in Red Skull (played by Hugo Weaving in some of the greatest make up work in a while), and you have a solid adventure yarn.\n\nWhile the final scene left me scratching my head a bit, feeling tacked on, and the scene before giving the real closure to the story, I think Marvel was trying to pump up The Avengers even more, so I get it, though it still deterred from an otherwise emotional ending. Even with this small bump in the road, it's really the only blemish in this extremely well made and polished superhero flick that doesn't reinvent the wheel, but neither breaks it. Solid, entertaining, and heroic, everything a good superhero movie should be, which is exactly what this movie is.\n\nI give Captain America: The First Avenger a 9 out of 10!",

        "reviewText": "2011 is certainly the year for Marvel Studio, seeing that Thor came out earlier in the year to good reviews and a healthy box-office considering he is a lesser known hero and Captain America has done even better with critics and a stronger opening. Added to that Fox's reboot of X-Men was able to get that series right after the mess Brett Ratner left it in.\n\nSteve Rogers (Chris Evans) is a small, skinny man with a number of health problems who wants to fight in the American Army in 1942. After numerous times of trying to enlist a German scientist, Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) sees his determination and good heart is able to pull some strings and gets him into the army. Rogers joins a special unit and is seen as the perfect candidate to become America's first super soldier, giving him enhanced strength, speed and healing abilities. In Germany the Nazi's secret science division, HYDRA and its leader Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving) discovers a blue cube of energy and believes it could give him the power of the Gods and likes all mad scientists plans to take over the world. In America Rogers is made into a performing act, encouraging the public to buy war bonds and given the name Captain America. But Rogers wants to fight in the war and is given his chance to take on HYDRA in 1943.\n\nI personally preferred Thor over Captain America, but it still a fun summer flick and a solid 7.5/10. Captain America has plenty of references to Thor and the Iron Man films and shows how these franchise should be interlinked. Captain America is able to mix a light touch but making sure it treats the source material with respect and keeps it serious. Joe Johnston wouldn't have been my first choice to direct this film but certainly made it fun and he was more assured as an action director compared to Kenneth Brangh, director of Thor. It was a fast paced actioneer, but Johnston made sure they was enough time to let us know the characters and the set up for the plot. When Captain America first gains his powers the scene of him catching an assassin on top of a taxi reminded me a lot of the first Spider-man film, a film that got mix of serious and light-hearted right. This was certainly a good introduction to character and the start for what should be another successful adaptation for Marvel.\n\nThe humour throughout the film is deadpan and there are very good performance from the supporting cast, especially Weaving, Tommy Lee Jones and Tucci. Weaving certainly knows how to portray evil characters. Evans was able to instill Captain America's values of determination, freedom, strength and being a force for good. But the thing about Captain America is that he is a classic hero, living in a world of absolutes of good and evil, they is no ambiguity. And well, Hayley Atwell is a token Brit so she gets a free pass.\n\nThe score by Alan Silverstri it self has an old fashion, grand feel to it and there were reminds to films such as the first Hellboy film, starting during World War Two with the Nazis using mythology to gain an advantage to win the war and classic 60s and 70s war films like Where Eagles Dare.\n\nCaptain America is an enjoyable blockbuster and necessary viewing if you plan to view The Avengers in 2012.",

Slam-bam crackerjack origin story of the classic Marvel Comics' titular patriotic hero (with an amiable Evans) AKA Steve Rogers, a 98 lb. scrawny kid from Brooklyn trying to do his gung-ho best for America during WWII, finding himself transformed into a pec-laden super soldier and facing the nefarious Nazi villain Johann Schmidt ‚Äì AKA The Red Skull(a fierce steely-eyed Weaving) ‚Äì hell bent on world domination. Along for the ride are the estimable Tucci as the German √©migr√© scientist Erskine whose top-secret serum gives the hero his juice; Jones as crusty as ever as the taciturn Colonel Phillips and comely aide de camp Peggy Carter (the luscious Atwell), all provide fine ensemble work. Credit yeoman director Joe Johnston to let Christopher Markus' & Stephen McFeeley's adaption fly freely with a peppering of humor and pathos, great rousing score by veteran composter Alan Silvestri; ace sepia toned cinematography by Shelly Johnson, evoking the era perfectly; expert production design by Rick Heinrichs and great costumes by Anna B. Sheppard. The 3-D is pretty nifty w/Cap's trusty shield thrown your way for good measure; Saturday matin√©e vibe only adds to the movie magic.",

        "reviewText": "There's an air of genial and gentle good humor pervading the early scenes in \"Captain America\" whereby we're treated to the scenes involving the scrawny but scrappy young man Steve Rogers before his body transformation into the title hero makes him look like he stepped out of a recruiting poster. And this combination of humor and charm continues even as the tale becomes full of the revenge motif once our hero embarks on his more dangerous course as the man who must fight his nemesis, The Red Skull, rescuing the world as well as his good buddy from enemy hands. CHRIS EVANS is highly capable of making us believe in his \"Captain America,\" before and after the transformation.\n\nAs summer blockbusters go, \"Captain America\" ranks with one of the best. Within the scope of little more than two hours it sets up the Marvel comic with a flair and style worthy of more important material, succeeding in recreating the WWII era (from a World's Fair with art deco touches to the USO entertainments), with costumes, sets and characters all firmly set in traditional 1940s style.\n\nAnd the cast is up to bringing all this material to life. HUGO WEAVER has a fine time as the crazed mastermind out to ruthlessly destroy his enemies. He's a sort of Conrad Veidt villain on steroids. TOMMY LEE JONES as a gruff colonel with a heart of gold, HAYLEY ATWELL as a pretty soldier who knows how to throw a punch, and SEBASTIAN STAN as our hero's best buddy--all of them shine in colorful supporting roles. DOMINIC COOPER as Howard Stark and STANLEY TUCCI as Dr. Erskine bring additional humor and grace to their parts.\n\nJoe Johnston's direction gives the light touch where needed (especially during the USO shows where Captain America is being used as a poster boy before the troops), but never falters during the explosive action scenes.\n\nLikewise, Alan Silvestri's jaunty score never fails to support the on screen antics with some flag-waving patriotism suitable for the movie's thematics, and assures the viewer from the start that all he has to do is sit back and enjoy a well-delivered popcorn package of thrills and laughs.\n\nRecommended for all Marvel fans.",

I know when a film is being produced and directed by people outside the comics industry that some things are lost in translation and some things are changed simply so the director can put their individual mark on it. Up until last month, Iron Man was the best movie to capture the main idea of the character and story, in my opinion. Iron Man was a very true to the mythos and great to watch. Captain America is better and that is not taking anything away from Iron Man. Yes, still some aspects of the story was changed, but I felt this was a great translation that captured and added to Captain America. They handled the background story and cast of characters with intelligence. I think the original intent of Captain America's creator comes through and what his values were. They did a great job with Steve Rogers pre-super soldier serum with the visual effects. The plot was very good and moved along well developing the story. I do not even remember any bad language at all which is rare these days. If you like super heroes and want to be entertained for two hours then this movie will do it.",

      "text": "Bright headlights cut through a thick sheet of snowflakes. A scientist, bundled as warmly as possible, treks through the sleet. Two other men, in matching black cold-weather uniforms, approach the scientist. He leads them to an excavation site which is easily the size of a football field; at the center of the site appears to be a giant wing and fuselage. The black-suited men cut through the fuselage of the mystery craft and enter. Inside they find the remains of a massive, frozen ship. One of the men brushes away at the snow and sees a shimmering red, white, and blue shield encased in ice.\n\nTonsberg, Norway, 1942:\n\nTwo caretakers for an ancient Viking ruin listen as their town is overrun by Nazis. Suddenly the front door blasts open and in flood multiple Nazi agents. One of the caretakers is killed in the blast and the other frantically begs that the soldiers leave him in peace. They pay no attention to the old man and instead open the building's crypts one-by-one. They come to one sarcophagus whose lid is too heavy to lift. A dark figure appears in the exploded entryway. Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving), a high-ranking Nazi and leader of the HYDRA sect, nonchalantly enters. He crosses the room, comes to the difficult-to-open sarcophagus and easily pushes the lid free. Within he finds the skeletal remains of an old Viking clutching a glass cube (the Tesseract). The caretaker pleads for Schmidt to leave it. Schmidt scoffs and tells how this cube would be the jewel of Odin's treasury if it weren't a fake. He smashes it on the floor and goes to the caretaker, asking where the real cube is hidden. The caretaker initially refuses but under threat of harm to his family, he relents, gesturing to a hidden drawer across the room, part of an ancient carving the size of the wall. Schmidt pries the drawer open and finds the real, glowing cube concealed within. Schmidt orders his men to shell the city and then shoots the luckless caretaker.\n\nAt a recruiting station in Brooklyn, Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), a 20-something, 90 lb, 5-foot tall asthmatic eagerly awaits the opportunity to enlist in the United States Army. The army doctor gives a once-over to Steve's medical file, which reads like that of a 90 year old man, and rejects Steve's application as the military 4-F, as this is his fourth failed attempt to enlist.\n\nDistraught, Steve heads to the movies. He envies the enlisted men featured in the pre-show newsreel, and watches as other audience members tear up. A loud-mouthed, impatient movie-goer begins yelling at the screen \"Start the movie! I didn't pay to see this crap!\" Steve tells the man to shut up, and is surprised as the man turns around, stands up and towers above him. In the alley behind the theater the bully savagely beats the scrawny Steve, who bravely fights back, but is easily overpowered. When his opponent asks him why he won't simply give up, the bloodied Steve says \"I can do this all day.\" James \"Bucky\" Barnes (Sebastian Stan), Steve's best friend, comes running to the alley. He swiftly kicks the bully away and tends to Steve, who is annoyed that Bucky showed up and got rid of the bully just as Steve got his second wind. \"Bucky\" is now an enlisted-man. His application was accepted and he's been assigned to the 107th infantry.\n\nIn a celebratory mood, Bucky invites Steve to go dancing with a pair of girls on a double date. Bashfully, Steve tags along. The four head to the World's Fair in Queens. While Bucky canoodles with his dates, Steve watches as playboy inventor Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper) unsuccessfully demonstrates a flying car. Steve breaks away from the group and goes to another recruiting station. Bucky catches up with him and asks how Steve intends to forge his application this time. Unbeknownst to them both, Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) while passing by, eavesdrops on their conversation. He is fascinated by the gumption of Steve. Bucky wishes Steve good luck on his latest application and Steve heads in to the recruiting station for his fifth physical. Inside Steve sits on an examination table and grows nervous when an MP enters the room, and is soon followed by Dr. Erskine. Dr. Erskine has all of Steve's prior applications on file. Concerned by Steve's failed applications, Erskine tests his character by asking if his insistence on applying for military service is driven purely by a desire to kill Nazis. The young man sincerely reveals that he is not a killer at heart, but does not like \"bullies\" regardless of their origin; he also shows little concern when Erksine reveals that he is German by birth. Won over by Steve's strong will and unwavering conviction, Erksine accepts his latest application.\n\nIn a secret military installation high in the Alps, Johann Schmidt brings the glowing cube to Dr. Arnim Zola, his Hydra weapon specialist. The cube's seemingly limitless power enables Schmidt and Dr. Zola to power unstoppable energy guns and cannons.\n\nMeanwhile, Steve has been enlisted into basic training under the careful watch of Dr. Erskine and Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones). He and his platoon are told that they are candidates for the government's latest Super Soldier program. Phillips is unimpressed with Steve and is vexed by Dr. Erskine's interest in him. During basic training Steve meets a beautiful but driven British officer, Peggy Carter (Haley Atwell), who seems to pity him. Despite being the smallest and weakest of the platoon, Steve demonstrates the greatest spirit, selflessness and ingenuity, especially when his platoon are charged with retrieving a flag from the top of a tall pole: as the other, more fit men in the company fail the task one by one as they try to climb up the pole, Steve casually pulls the pin holding it up, taking the flag when the pole crashes to the ground. Phillips, still unconvinced, tosses a grenade into the group during calisthenics and they all scatter. Phillips is surprised when Steve alone leaps on top of it, willing to sacrifice himself to save the others, before discovering that the grenade was a dummy. Phillips concedes to Erskine's decision.\n\nThat evening, Dr. Erskine speaks with Steve. The two bond over a bottle of Schnapps and Dr. Erskine reveals that this is not his first time performing this experiment. He tells a story of how, prior to his emigration to the US, he was ordered by Johann Schmidt to create a serum that would give a man god-like strength. Dr. Erskine created an early version of the serum he intends to use on Steve, only when Schmidt injected himself his body's skin corroded away, leaving him as a sinewy red skeleton. Undeterred by the risk, Steve agrees to follow through with the procedure.\n\nThe following morning Steve and Peggy wind their way through Brooklyn and come to a stop in front of an old antique shop. Along the way Steve points out various parts in Brooklyn where he's been beaten up. She asks him why he never ran away. He responds that running away, in his mind, was an invitation for further abuse.\n\nThe two enter the antique shop, exchange pass-codes with an old woman manning the register, and descend into a secret military bunker concealed within. Peggy leads Steve to the heart of the bunker where they find Dr. Erskine preparing a medical capsule along with Howard Stark, and Colonel Phillips rubbing elbows with senators and dignitaries. Steve is told to remove his shirt and sit in the capsule. Stark describes that the procedure will first mean injecting muscle re-generators into Rogers' major muscle groups which will then be bombarded with \"vita rays.\" Erskine has made no secret of the pain Steve will endure but promises he'll come out stronger. Carter bids Steve good luck and joins Phillips in the overhead viewing chamber. Erskine's serum is injected into Steve's muscles and Steve is enclosed within the vita ray capsule. The capsule glows brightly, Steve yells in pain but also tells them to continue and the procedure is quickly completed. When the capsule is shut down, Steve comes out a foot taller and a hundred pounds heavier with solid muscle, which is just the most superficial aspects of his body artificially raised to the maximum human potential.\n\nEverybody, including Phillips, celebrates the success of the procedure, and descends from the viewing chamber to congratulate Erskine. A lone dignitary, in actuality a German spy named Heinz Kruger (Richard Armitage), stays behind, placing a small satchel on a chair. Moments later the viewing gallery explodes. Kruger descends the stairs and fatally shoots Dr. Erskine twice. He swiftly kills the guards and flees onto the streets with Peggy in hot pursuit. Steve tends to a dying Dr. Erskine, who has just enough energy to point to Steve's heart before he dies. Steve bolts out of the bunker, in pursuit of Kruger.\n\nIn the street Peggy pursues Kruger, and easily kills his getaway driver. Kruger steals a taxi and aims to run over Peggy. Steve arrives in the nick of time, saving her from being killed by the on-coming taxi. Steve pursues the taxi on foot, running faster than a normal human can (and not suffering the fatigue even a healthy man would). Displaying superhuman agility, he leaps onto the roof of the taxi, dodges Kruger's gunfire and the two come to a crashing stop at the Brooklyn docks. Kruger shoots at Steve, who holds the star-imprinted door of the wrecked cab in front of him as a shield. Kruger flees to his Hydra sub, which dives underwater just as Steve arrives. Steve dives after the sub, punches a hole through the cockpit's glass and yanks Kruger to the surface. Kruger tells Steve that he is the first of many, that Rogers can \"cut off one head,\" but two more take it's place.\" He then kills himself with a cyanide capsule hidden in a fake tooth, letting out one last \"Heil HYDRA!\" before dying.\n\nMeanwhile, Schmidt and Dr. Zola are visited by a trio of Hitler's top commanders, tasked with inspecting Schmidt's operation. They ridicule Schmidt, saying that the Nazi party no longer takes him and HYDRA seriously due to his obsession with magic and the occult and playfully refer to him as \"The Red Skull\", a name that infuriates Schmidt. Schmidt takes the three to his weapons lab where they are shown his unstoppable energy weapons and a strategic map of Europe dotted with targets. One of the three notices a target hovering over Berlin and confronts Schmidt. Schmidt quickly vaporizes the three Nazi officers. Schmidt announces that HYDRA has disbanded from the Nazi party and is now enemies with the world.\n\nThe following day Phillips and Carter pick up the remains of Dr. Erskine's lab. Both are despondent because the only person capable of producing the serum was Erskine himself. Steve is eager to go the front lines of the European Theatre but Phillips would rather he be a lab-rat than a soldier in his army. Steve is approached by a senator holding a newspaper of the prior day's events, emblazoned with a front-page photo of Steve chasing down Heinz Kruger. Steve has become an overnight celebrity and the Senator has an idea that will be mutually beneficial.\n\nSteve is enlisted in the USO (United Service Organizations), and travels around the Midwest, promoting war bonds and performing musical numbers in a shoddy red, white and blue costume while carrying a triangle-shaped shield bearing the stars-and-stripes. He takes on the name \"Captain America\" and the show includes a theme song written specifically for him, features dancing girls and a short segment where he punches out Hitler, played by an actor. Captain America becomes an overnight success, spawning comic books and black and white movies. His antics drum up revenue for the USO.\n\nSteve is soon taken overseas, to Italy, where he is to continue entertaining the troops. Upon his arrival the surly and war-torn men tease him and tell him to get lost. He is soon met by Carter, who along with Phillips, is overseeing European Theatre of the war. She tells him that the men are unhappy because many men from their division, the 107th Infantry, have been killed in battle. Steve realizes that this is Bucky's division, and quickly runs to see Phillips. Phillips is unable to find Bucky's name on his casualty list and tells Steve to go back to his job as a movie star and a cheerleader. Steve asks Carter where the men, and Bucky, are being held. She shows him a map, and a known HYDRA weapons factory 30-40 miles behind enemy lines. Steve hastily pulls on a pair of army trousers and leather jacket over his Captain America costume, and a blue helmet with a white 'A' stamped on the front. He aims to steal a jeep and drive into HYDRA's back yard, but she has a better idea.\n\nHoward Stark flies them both over the battlefield in his private plane. Steve surmises that Stark and Carter have a relationship and bashfully withholds his feelings for her. Just as anti-aircraft guns from HYDRA begin firing on Stark's plane, Steve parachutes in, while the other two escape back to safety. Steve stealthily makes his way into the HYDRA base, taking out numerous guards in the process.\n\nInside, Schmidt and Zola are manufacturing enough weapons to wipe out every capital in the world. Steve makes his way to the holding cells where he sees hundreds of imprisoned men from the 107th. He frees the men and tells them to make a \"messy\" exit. Under the leadership of the \"Howling Commandos\" the prisoners manage to overpower their captors, steal guns and tanks, and escape from the facility, destroying much of it. Schmidt watches Steve by CCTV, and quickly realizes that he must be Erskine's man. He quickly activates several explosive charges that will level the base.\n\nSteve makes his way through the facility and happens across Bucky, who is tied down to an operating table, and has quite obviously been tortured. Steve also notices an oversized tactical map mounted on the wall, with various marked installations. Steve frees Bucky, who is surprised to see that Steve is taller than him, and commits the map to memory.\n\nThe two head up the catwalks and find themselves face to face with Schmidt on a retractable bridge. Rogers punches Schmidt, who surprisingly stands his ground. Schmidt plays with his face, which has apparently come free from his skull, and quickly peels it away as a mask. The Red Skull stares back at Rogers and Bucky and swiftly enters an elevator. In the elevator The Red Skull tells Arnim Zola to meet him at another one of Hydra's bases and to take his car. The Red Skull escapes the exploding facility in a strangely-designed private plane while Zola sneaks away in Schmidt's roadster. Inside Steve and Bucky have a huge divide to cross to their freedom. Bucky crosses a trembling, buckling support beam and manages to cross to safety moments before the beam plummets into the fire below. Left with no other option, Steve backs up as far as he can and leaps over the burning chasm.\n\nBack at the 107th base camp, Phillips dictates a letter to his typist, telling how Rogers disappeared the prior night and likely perished during the battle. At that, Phillips berates Agent Carter for causing this loss and notes that unlike the indispensable Stark, she herself can be punished. Carter attempts to justify her actions, but Phillips bluntly dismisses her opinions considering that the loss of Rogers, the only successful test subject of Project: Rebirth, would be ample justification to close down their organization. Just then, Rogers arrives, with nearly 400 survivors of the 107th carrying samples of the Red Skull's technology including some combat vehicles leaving the base in a fervor. Rogers submits himself to Phillips for disciplinary action for going out in direct violation of orders, but is forgiven. At this success, Bucky calls for cheers for Rogers, who has truly become Captain America.\n\nThe news of \"Captain America's\" success on the battlefield has swept over the world, but Rogers does not appear for his medal from Congress. The reason for that absence is in London, where Steve gives Phillips and Carter his best recollection of the HYDRA base map and tells them that he intends to go to those bases and destroy them one by one, and wishes to recruit a team of men made up of those he liberated in Italy. Steve meets the Howling Commandos in a bar and they eagerly accept the offer. While there all the men are surprised as Peggy enters dressed in a form-fitting cocktail dress. She ignores all the men, including Bucky, and flirts with Steve, telling him that she'd love to have a dance with him some day.\n\nThe next day Steve is summoned to the Brooklyn bunker to see Phillips and Stark. Steve is approached by a beautiful female officer who wishes to thank him for his service the best way she knows how. Peggy walks in on Steve kissing the enlisted-woman and angrily storms away. Steve apologetically follows her to Stark's lab, insisting that he gets nervous around women and asks why he should apologize if Carter and Stark have a thing going. Stark quickly shoots down the rumored relationship and takes Steve to his weapons engineering lab. He remarks that Rogers has become attached to the triangular shield, which Steve says is a handy tool in the field. On a table are several prototype shields with sophisticated components, however Steve finds a plain, circular shield on a lower shelf. Stark explains that the shield is made of a metal called \"vibranium\", which is lighter than steel and is vibration resistant and will absorb heavy impacts. He holds the shield in front of him and asks Peggy for his opinion. She playfully/scornfully fires a clip from a .45 pistol at the shield, which Steve ducks behind. The shield passes the improvised test admirably. As she walks off, Steve passes a sketch of a uniform to Stark.\n\nSteve dresses in red, white and blue fatigues, dons a blue form-fitting helmet and stows the newly-colored shield onto his back. Captain America and his soldiers, including Bucky, make their way across Europe, flattening Hydra's bases one by one, with Rogers becoming quite skilled at using the shield as a projectile weapon and also discovering that it can ricochet off several surfaces and lot lose any velocity. News of his exploits reach the Red Skull and Zola. The Skull is furious, referring to Rogers as a \"simpleton with a shield\" and murders the last man alive at one of his destroyed facilities.\n\nHigh in the Alps, Steve and his men have a mission to capture Zola in his personal train. Three members of the team, Cap, Bucky and Gabe Jones (Derek Luke), zip-line across a massive chasm and storm the train car by car. Soon Cap and Bucky are cornered by heavily armed Hydra soldiers. They narrowly defeat the soldiers, however Bucky is tossed from the train and plummets into an icy river below. Zola is apprehended.\n\nZola sits in a prison cell and is visited by Colonel Phillips, who brings him a steak dinner. Zola rejects the meal, convinced that it must be poisoned. Phillips shrugs and eats it himself. He tells Zola that he broadcast an easily decipherable message, which has certainly been intercepted by HYDRA, saying that Zola had defected. He also knows that Zola is easy to bargain with since he's the sole HYDRA agent they've captured who hasn't taken his cyanide capsule to avoid disclosing information. Zola, fearing that the lie will result in his death by the Red Skull, gives in to Phillips and tells him information of the Red Skull's only remaining HYDRA base.\n\nRogers sulks in a war-ravaged bar. Carter arrives and comforts Steve over the loss of his best friend. Steve realizes that Dr. Erskine's serum rapidly regrows dead cells, making it impossible for him to get drunk. The two flirt a bit and talk about having a dance, once again.\n\nRogers and his team prepare a battle plan to take down Red Skull at his headquarters. Rogers, dressed in a new uniform, mounts a Harley and charges the base. He easily dodges HYDRA soldiers and tanks and finds himself within the base, surrounded by a HYDRA army. He is taken into custody and led to the Red Skull's private weapons lab. Red Skull asks what makes Steve so special. Steve says \"Nothing, I'm just a kid from Brooklyn,\" moments before members of his team zip-line into Red Skull's office.\n\nA climatic firefight ensues, as hundreds of soldiers under the direction of Phillips and Carter storm the base, killing many HYDRA soldiers. Red Skull flees to his private hangar, in which a gigantic flying wing, powered by the Tesseract, is preparing for take off. Steve attempts to catch up with the plane on foot, but is unable. Phillips and Carter arrive in the Skull's roadster, and the three take off after the plane. Just as Steve is about to leap onto the plane Peggy stops him and kisses him. Steve leaps from the roadster onto one of the plane's massive wheels. He sneaks into the craft where he finds dozens of kamikaze planes/missiles, each labeled with a different major American city. Hydra soldiers soon enter the room and Steve battles them, taking out numerous men and tiny planes. One of the planes, labeled New York, drops free. Steve takes off after it and manages to commandeer the craft and crashes it back into the flying wing after throwing the pilot through its rearward mounted propeller.\n\nInside the large cockpit, Captain America and Red Skull have a fisticuffs battle. Red Skull fires his cube-energy pistol at Steve who easily deflects the shots using his shield. A shot is deflected into one of the cockpit's center consoles which contains the glowing blue cube. The console is damaged and Skull lifts the cube into the air. Suddenly a portal opens above him, showing starry space. The Red Skull glows brightly and is seemingly disintegrated. His remains are swept up into the cosmos. The cube, still glowing brightly, drops to the ground and burns its way down through the plane's hull before plummeting into the ocean below. Steve mans the plane's controls and radios Carter. He tells her that the plane is on a flight-path that will take them to the Eastern Seaboard. He tells her that their dance will have to wait. He pushes the plane into a dive and crashes it into a glacier below. Peggy can only hear static.\n\nSteve awakens in a 1940's hospital. An old-fashioned radio transmits the play-by-play of a Brooklyn Dodgers game. He gets up, looks out the windows and watches as the hospital door opens. A young nurse (Amanda Righetti) who bares a striking resemblance to Peggy enters. She waits for a response from Steve, who looks her over suspiciously. He asks why the radio is playing a game from May 1941... specifically, a game that he knows he attended. She reaches into her pocket and withdraws a two-way radio. Two tall soldiers in black uniforms enter the room, and Steve easily tosses them through a wall. Steve steps through the hole and is surprised to see that the 'hospital' is in fact a movie-set. He runs through the dark corridors, pushes a door open, and finds himself in a modern skyscraper bustling with people in business suits. He flees the building and finds himself in Times Square, circa 2011. He peers around, shocked by his surroundings, and watches as numerous matching black SUVs encircle him.\n\nNick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) appears and carefully speaks to Steve. He tells him that he's been asleep, in ice, for 70 years, in a state of suspended animation. The hospital set was meant to gradually introduce him to modern society. Still perplexed, Steve breathes heavily and sadly tells Fury that he had a date, as he realizes everyone else he used to know in the 1940s is long dead or very old now.\n\nIn a post-credit scene, Steve is in an old-fashioned gym. He pummels a punching bag so hard that he knocks it off its chain and sends it flying across the room. Fury enters the gym and asks Steve if he's had trouble sleeping. Steve cynically asks if Fury has come with another mission. Fury replies in the affirmative.\n\nSuddenly we see images of all the superheroes, who include Steve/Captain America, Thor (from the movie of the same name), Tony Stark (from the 'Ironman' movies), Hawkeye, Black Widow, Bruce Banner (from 'The Incredible Hulk') and other Shield agents preparing for battle. Fury tells him that \"they're up.\" His personal mission to build an army of superheroes is complete, previewing The Avengers."

        "reviewText": "When an incident involving Wanda Maximoff causes a deadly explosion in Lagos, the UN want to regulate the use of the Avengers.\n\n'Captain America Civil War' is an enjoyable but slightly overlong MCU movie that has some fantastic spectacle and strong character moments.\n\nThe plot has an excellent premise with a plausible world reaction to the exploits of a group of people with superpowers and a good villain. Where it slightly falters as a stand-alone movie is the introduction of several new characters that somewhat bogs down the proceedings, but for the wider franchise narrative (and expansion) it is necessary. Several characters have emotional arcs to go through in this story and there is only so much time to do it all.\n\nAll that being said it has some of the best moments of the franchise, particularly during the scenes of internal conflict amongst the central characters. Iron Man, Black Panther, Captain America and the Winter Soldier are involved in some very compelling scenes, as are Wanda and Vision.\n\nSome of the visuals are incredibly well done. The early Lagos action scenes hit like a sledgehammer and you can almost feel the impact of what is being shown. The airport showdown is excessive but so much fun you can imagine the writers planning a fanboy's ultimate fantasy. The final confrontation is well made from a spectacle and character perspective.\n\nThe first time I saw it was my first sight of the digital effect that makes actors appear younger. This is a very impressive use of CGI that feels like real movie magic.\n\nAll performances are strong especially Robert Downey Jr and Daniel Bruhl.\n\nIt's a 7.5/10 for me but I round upwards.",

        "reviewText": "What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.\n\nThe same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.\n\nThese two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.\n\nThis film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",

The characters are well written. We are introduced to two new characters such as Black Panther and Spider-Man, even in their minimum screentime they were amazing. It takes time and depth to understand Tony's decisons, during the final moments of the final battle he was consumed by vengeance and his emotions and not guided by his intellect.

        "reviewText": "I don't understand the hate for this movie it actually surprised me, I really enjoyed this film. Captain America: Civil War is a descent awesome MCU super action the third film of the Captain America trilogy. To me the second movie Captain America: The Winter Soldier is still the best one I just love that movie to death, but I like this one I love the first one but I just love all three of Captain America films. I thought the cast did a good job Chris Evens kicks ass once again he is Captain America and I look this movie from his point of view. He is really become my favorite hero of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the Avengers films especially Age of Ultron, Captain America is still a guy who has a lot of screen time that it is the focus of a movie and he is still the guy I can take a side I agree with him, I can understand his choices.\n\nWe have also almost everyone from Avengers films except Thor and Hulk actors Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo did not appear. Chris Hemsworth thought that MCU fired him because he was not cast as Thor but he was later explained that MCU wants his own movie and his own stand alone path which I can't wait for Thor: Ragnarok.\n\nThe cast beside Chris Evens includes Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Emily VanCamp, Tom Holland, Frank Grillo, William Hurt, and Daniel Br√ºhl.\n\nIn Captain America: Civil War, disagreement over international oversight of the Avengers fractures them into opposing factions-one led by Steve Rogers and the other by Tony Stark. We have two opposite teams now fighting each other:\n\nTeam Iron Man: War Machine, Black Widow, Black Panther, The Vision, Spider-Man.\n\nTeam Captain America: Hawkeye, Sharon Carter, Falcon, Bucky Barnes, Ant-Man, Scarlet Witch.\n\nThe battle between Captain America and Iron Man draws a political line in the sand. On one side, you have Tony Stark, a man looking to protect the world from super-powered individuals who've proved in the past to be more destructive than helpful. On the other, you have Steve Rogers championing civil liberties. It's the age old debate of safety coming at the cost of freedom, and we'll get to see it play out to a hopefully satisfying conclusion this year.\n\nThe action scenes are fantastic, the fight scenes on the airport are incredible heart pulse breath taking awesome. The fight scenes were very well done and well choreographed. I liked this movie more the story drew me in, the villain wasn't that good.\n\nRobert Downey Jr. Does a good job, Paul Rudd he is fun in the flick, he has a great moment as Ant-Man he has a few moments but one predictable. Scarlett Johansson did great! Black Widow kicked ass specially in the beginning of the flick. Anthony Mackie I really like him as Falcon he as a lot of good stuff in this. He was down played in Age of Ultron but has a lot screen time in here which was excellent and they made that for that in this one I am glad for it. Anthony Mackie has a lot of good screen time, specially in the action moments. Falcon has a remote control like a mini Flacon I thought that was really cool. Chris Evens is to root for this character, Black Panther interesting the actor playing black panther was really good I like him and I am really interested seeing his up coming movie. Bucky Barnes: Winter Soldier did fine.\n\nA lot of people are complain about how terrible this movie is I am sorry I don't see it that way, I don't see at all it is peace of sh**. I wish that Frank Grillo as Brock Rumlow / Crossbones wouldn't die and it was nice to see him in the beginning of the movie. I still wish he would work for the villain I still enjoy his screen time.\n\nI thought Chris Evens and Robert Downey Jr, did work great as a opposite team. I love the end of fighting between Cap, Iron Man and Bucky Barnes. I thought the last fight scene was well choreographed I honestly think Iron Man would have won and he would killed Bucky Barnes. If Cap wouldn't have hurt his heart. I know when Tony find out Bucky killed his parents and he killed his mom in 1991 he decide to kill him. I mourn with Tony and it was a great dialogue \"That shield doesn't belong to you. You don't deserve it! My father made that shield!\"\n\nCaptain America: Civil War is a 2016 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Captain America, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.\n\nI understand the hate, because Captain turn the law politics back to save his friend, but he actually try to safe an innocent man who was framed by Zemo.\n\nCaptain America Civil War WAS BETTER THAN X-MEN APOCALYPSE, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Man of Steel and Deadpool I don't like those movies they are peace of sh** and too way overrated. The rating I am giving is 10/10.",

        "reviewText": "Captain America: Winter Soldier was everything I wanted from a superhero movie. It was well directed, written and acted, and I was very excited for the next Captain America movie. And this movie most definietly delivered in quality. Is it as good as its predecessor? No, definietly not. There are a few flaws, which I'll talk about later. With that being said, this movie gets 4 things right for every one thing it does wrong. The plot is engaging and for the most part easy to follow and the pacing is solid. The characters all feel very 3-dimentional and fleshed out, and none of them feel different from what we already know. The movie's biggest strength is the interactions between the characters, and the different arguments presented by both sides. I love that despite obviously wanting us to side with Cap's team, the movie doesn't really make one side the \"correct\" one. Both sides present reasonable and logical arguments, and there is no right answer to what the Avengers should do. The new characters such as Black Panther and Spiderman are both very interesting and compelling, and both feel like a natural inclusion to the character list. All this is of course helped by some excellent performances as usual. The direction and cinematography are also both really good, and the action scenes are almost just as good as in Winter Soldier, even though some feel a little meaningless. And, while it might not be a big deal, MAN was it good to see a truly great antagonist in Zemo. He's well written and very well played by Daniel Br√ºhl, and he challenges the ideological perspectives of our hero in a way no other villain in the MCU has done before. With that being said, his plan is somewhat ridiculous, and felt a little too complicated. The movie also feels a little dumb sometimes. It feels like Cap and Stark could've solved the issue much sooner had they just communicated better. Those are my main complaints, and while there are a few other things I could nitpick, nothing really ruins the film by any means. It's a more mature take on the Marvel formula, and while it's the best movie in the franchise, it's still more than good enough for me to recommend it.",

        "reviewText": "Superhero fatigue is a problem that many people think is starting to settle in. Fantastic Four was an abysmal film and it made less than Spy Kids 3D: Game Over. Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice received terrible reviews and had one of the biggest Friday to Sunday drops. Are people sick of these films? Well, not if you're in the Marvel family it seems. For one thing, Marvel actually takes pride and careful attention to detail with their films, both the previously mentioned titles are rush jobs for specific reasons. Civil War is proof that the good guy vs good guy aspect of superhero films can be done right.\n\nThe world wants to hold the Avengers accountable for all the death and destruction they've caused over the years, so the United Nations put together the Sokovia Accords, which means the Avengers would work for them. Tony Stark supports this. Steve Rogers does not. Things get more complicated when Bucky turns up again and is the prime suspect in a bombing that kills dozens of people. With two prominent members of the Avengers on opposing sides of the issue, will the team ever be the same again?\n\nCivil War has a lot going for it. Stellar cast, great characters, top-notch special effects, excellent action sequences, comedic relief and...well the list goes on. The Russo brothers have delivered a slick action film that makes me comfortable with the fact that they seem to be at the helm of the Marvel franchise now. When The Avengers was first announced, I thought it was going to be dreadful, then they said these guy named Joss Whedon was going to be directing it and my expectations instantly changed. Whedon delivered a great superhero film that set up the rest of the films to come. The Russo brothers now have the task of juggling all these characters and they do an admirable job.\n\nEach character has their shining moments, but the core of the story is Stark vs Rogers. So while it's fun to have Rudd come in and have a few laughs, I don't think anyone is expecting huge things from his character. Same with Spider-Man, who is forced in here to set up his future films within this weird shared universe with Sony. Those are not complaints, they both work wonderfully in the film. If I were to find a complaint it would be in the thought process of the villain, Zemo. His plan is so painstakingly convoluted that I wonder how it even worked at all. Too many things need to fall in place for him to get what he wants and it distracts from the emotional power of the climax. The actors and the history with the characters manage to save it a bit and do raise the stakes, but I had my problems nonetheless.\n\nThe grand spectacle at the airport between these characters was indeed a highlight. When you have characters like Vision and Scarlet Witch, who are so powerful they could end the fight instantly, it's a good idea to have them simply do damage control. I wondered how they would handle these two, they did a decent job of it. After this film, I can only hope that Infinity Wars goes this route and gives each Avenger a worthy foe to fight and not a hoard of mindless foot soldiers, which is exactly what the previous two Avengers films did. \n\nFans of the series will be pleased, the action is great (a bit shaky at first, but they let it breath later on) and some great introductions of new characters that will bring a fresh perspective to the franchise. Black Panther for one, steals a lot of the scenes he is in. Bold move to have such a big character \"show up\" in the film without a solo movie to set him up, but it works here. The cast is diversifying as more and more characters come into these films and I'm glad to see it. Tony Stark is great, RDJ does a great job with him, but we've seen the guy have a big role in these films 6 times now. I get that Marvel is scared to let some of these characters go because they are so integral to everything, but I honestly believe something along these lines needs to happen to bring more emotional depth to the franchise. For a studio willing to take chances are projects like Guardians of the Galaxy, they need to take a chance on this aspect as well.",

        "reviewText": "Alas, this film marks the point at which the Marvel film franchise slipped from the realm of powerful drama with larger-than-life characters, into pure Biff! Pow! fan service, with colorful super-manikins pitted needlessly and inappropriately against each other.\n\nThis slide is doubly sad, because the film starts so well. The question of vigilante justice has never been properly addressed in the superhero genre. Civil War starts by asking: what if the UN got involved? Should the Avengers yield their autonomy - their might-makes-right power, based purely on the accident of their own super-abilities? And furthermore, can even the UN or any other body be trusted to administer that kind of power?\n\n(Mild spoilers ahead.) That last question never gets properly asked, let alone answered. Instead, Civil War lapses into a succession of impressive but meaningless action sequences. Culminating in a completely unnecessary battle between every superhero in the Avengers side of the Marvel cinema franchise - and the total devastation of a major airport. Ironically, this is exactly the sort of billion-dollar collateral damage that the film starts out questioning. Now it goes by without any comment.\n\nSpider-Man is the most glaring insertion. He's completely superfluous to any plot line within the film. His presence is basically just an ad for the upcoming second reboot of his own franchise.\n\nFinally, there's the question of the 'civil war' itself. It's basically ludicrous. In the end, Iron Man learns something irrelevant, that causes him to totally lose his mind and nearly murder one of his closest friends. This goes far beyond even 'comic book logic,' into the realm of purely arbitrary plot twists. Director to script writer: \"It sez here that Cap and Shellhead pound on each other for 10 minutes - gimme a thin excuse, will ya?\"\n\nToo bad. Civil War looks great, has stupendous CG action sequences (especially the earlier, more human-scale ones), and fine performances by a number of good actors. But it marks a sad turn toward measuring worth not by solid dramatic or cinematic standards, but by the number of punches landed and the number of superheroes that can be crammed onto the screen at any one time.\n\nWe can hope this is an aberration, but it's a thin hope at best. This is how comics franchises traditionally die: strong ideas and deep characterization give way to mindless action and limp soap opera.",

Great cast and characters, superb action scenes with a pinch of humor, commendable VFX and an memorable ending.\n\nThe team has surely worked on the script and plot of the movie and this is a different plot altogether. The point which is to be noted is that the villain of the movie doesn't has any super power still he created the havoc amongst all the superheroes.\n\nScreenplay of the movie was superb and keeps you engaged through out the movie. Acting is the another strong aspect of the movie with some of the best Hollywood actors this department never disappointed. Climax of the movie is good.\n\nOne of the best Marvel movie with a great plot and good execution",

        "reviewText": "The Marvel universe gets tenser with the most-awaited \"Civil War\". For what fans clamor to be a storyline that the MCU is building towards, here comes a showdown of Marvel's biggest properties.\n\n\"Captain America 3\" starts off where \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" ended, when the New Avengers, led by Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), are cornered by international concern in response to continuous collateral damage. As a result, a governing act is proposed to the Avengers, fracturing the team to two sides, one led by Rogers and another led by Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.). But when a new threat is on the horizon, the team has to face the repercussions of their brawls.\n\nIt is a huge help that the Russo Brothers returned to hold the weights of Marvel's Phase Three, after their spontaneous effort in \"The Winter Soldier\". Though \"Civil War\" may not be as solid as its predecessor, it is still a worthy addition to the Avengers storyline and Captain America's saga. Yet, it excels for taking a mature route that brings a compelling character study, a token from the first Avengers movie. Out of such character study is the major theme of vengeance. I am not going to give any more details about it. It is best to be seen and be enamored by how such themes are delivered with an affecting yet entertaining vibe.\n\nKudos to the cast ensemble that all brought their A-game, even though some characters are not that fleshed out, or feeling shoehorned. Evans is at his most moving as the fading patriot who wishes the best for his team and loved ones. Downey Jr. is still what we expected from RDJ. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow has a neutral but affectionate presence, despite her rather little involvement. The rest of the cast is great to see, with notable breakout performances from Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant-Man/Giant-Man, Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa/Black Panther and Tom Holland as Spider-Man/Peter Parker. And Daniel Bruhl as Helmut Zemo is a better addition to Marvel's lacking lineup of antagonists. But despite the cast's collective efforts, there is an obvious battle for screen time with all characters. Thankfully, it was all salvaged as the two parties brawl in a cleared airport, in an exhilarating action sequence that will surely make every audience member cheer.\n\nFor all the makings of a summer blockbuster, \"Captain America: Civil War\" gets it all started right. Besides being a loyal companion to the comic book storyline, it is a worthy setup to Marvel's other properties and one that truly can hold on its own, courtesy of its consistent superhero action scenes, the Russo brothers' tense direction, the excellent cast, its thought-provoking themes and its exciting story with its signature Marvel snappy dialogue. Let us hope for the best for MCU's future, including Tom Holland's \"Spider-Man\".",

        "reviewText": "Captain America Civil War is the thirteenth film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, with a screenplay by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely. In Captain America: Civil War, disagreement over international oversight of the Avengers fractures them into opposing factions - one led by Steve Rogers and the other by Tony Stark. Civil War is definitely one of the best Marvel movies to date, and absolutely on par with The Winter Soldier which was also great. They are both on top in the Marvel Cinematic Movies ranking of mine so far. The conflict between these well beloved characters is done in a brilliant and fantastic way by the amazing Russo brothers who took the cheese out of the first Captain America movie , made one serious and great second movie, and build upon them both with the third outing. Everyone does a great job here, Chris Evans has made Captain America his own same as Robert Downey Jr for Iron Man. It features a very big ensemble cast and not one of them is anything less than great on the role. The fight scenes are also some of the best ever made in a comic book movie, even better than in The Winter Soldier. Especially the airport scene is just mesmerizing and totally stands out from everything else that's going on. Spider-Man is also unbelievably well done and Tom Holland is just fantastic. I am one of the few people who actually loved The Amazing Spider Man movies, and really got mad to hear that they are going to reboot the character again but I can see now that it was worth it. The visuals are great from beginning to end, the music is also good as usual. The villain is something that most people though it was the weakest point but I strongly disagree with that. He had reasoning as to why he is doing those things, and he pushes the other characters in new directions which is also necessary. I generally adored this movie, and even though I am a DC fan, there's just no denying that Marvel knows what they're doing and that is why they are much more successful right now.",

        "reviewText": "Hi,  I saw civil war and I come with good news; it's AWESOME!  Im not gonna spoil one single thing, since this movie should be seen by  only the two trailers you probably saw. Don't watch any tvspots after  the second trailer or whatever!  Im gonna touch a few aspects and rate them.  Acting: Of course it's amazing. The characters we were waiting for were  black panther and of course SPIDERMAN! Both were done amazing!  Spiderman has a bigger role than I personally expected and it's done  with grace. Love it. Black Panther was such a good character with great  motivation why he's doing what he's doing. The acting per usual from  the other characters were great! 10/10  Story: Now where another (let's leave it) unnamed superhero movie  failed this year, and no I'm not talking about dead-pool.., was the  story. Now this story is what I expected from the other unnamed  superhero movie. I didn't know what side I wanted to be on; cap's or  iron man's. I was so conflicted and even while they're fighting you  don't know who to root for. The villain in this movie felt a bit, not  really out of place, but unnecessary in my opinion. But Marvel always  struggles to find a good fleshed out villain except for Loki & kingpin  in the series. 8/10   Action/Cinematography: O boy..If you're an action freak you will love  this, if you're a comic book fan.. you're gonna LIVE these amazing  action set pieces. The much anticipated airport scene is AMAZING.  You've seen nothing, literally nothing of the amazing action that will  bestow upon you guys. The airport scene is in complete imax and has a  runtime of around 17 minutes. Just let that sink in! The Russo brothers  know how to create great action and film it great as well. I can go on  record and say this is by far the best superhero action scenes ever.  20/10.   Verdict: Was it a perfect movie? No. But for me as a fan it came darn  close. The only thing that bothered me were the villains, well actually  one of the few that are in there.   Was it better than... Batman v superman.. yes by far. I mean we're in a  comic book movie year, so we might as well compare it. Batman v  superman lacked in a lot of places and civil war just did it better.  Just the conflict in ideologies made it so much more believable why the  characters fought and because this whole story arc is happening now  after 2 cross over movies, 3 iron movies and 2 cap movies.. the stakes  are so incredibly high. I tried to compare dead-pool with it as well,  but it's a different movie in terms of it being a solo movie and  setting something up, instead of showing a conflict between good and  good instead of good and evil.   9 out of 10! Near Perfect movie for the fans(9.5) and a good solid  action film for the general movie go-ers(9)",

        "reviewText": "The Winter Soldier has competition for being the best Marvel movie. There's no other way to say it: Civil War is phenomenal. Marvel continues the trend of upping the stakes by pinning our favorite heroes against each other: Captain America and Iron Man. There are a lot of other characters, so much so that it feels more like an Avengers movie than a solo movie, but the story is told in such a way that the spotlight is always on Cap and Bucky.\n\nCivil War is tonally different from Winter Soldier in that it's more bombastic in its storytelling. Again, there are a lot of Avengers in the movie (more than the freaking Avengers movie). While Winter Soldier was a relatively grounded, dark political thriller, Civil War is a louder, more colorful take on the political theme, and a much more personal one as well. This time it's a matter of morals and ethics, and it's amazing how the movie pulls off giving each side of the argument weight and credibility so you could argue about who's right and who's wrong all day. \n\nSteve wants to protect his best friend Bucky who was brainwashed by Hydra and is now a fugitive from the law. He doesn't trust any form of government faction. He saw how far up corruption goes and he's not willing to lose jurisdiction of the Avengers to yet another corrupt governmental body. Tony wants everyone to sign an agreement for the UN so they won't be seen as a threat by the world governments due to their track record of leaving behind messes and casualties. It's a terrific plot, very thrilling and character driven. At its core it's a very personal story between Steve and Tony. The other characters are written as complimentary pieces to one puzzle. It's not gratuitous at all. You understand everyone's ideologies - why they disagree with each other, why they're on the sides that they're on, why they're fighting for what they're fighting for - and they're each given enough screen time for us to care. And the action scenes are TWS level. Nothing quite beats the first confrontation between CA and WS, but the end of the second act of this movie has an action sequence that is absolutely mesmerizing. It's the civil war. Seeing all of these superheros go against each other is exhilarating, and their interactions are hysterical, especially since a lot of them are meeting each other for the first time.\n\nThe new characters are excellent - Black Panther makes a hell of an impression as a sophisticated Wakandan diplomat, and Spider-Man is easily the best live action interpretation of the character; major props to Tom Holland for sounding exactly how you'd expect Spider-Man to sound like. It's an absolute joy to watch. One aspect of Civil War I find especially fascinating is the use of its villain, Zemo. You have no idea what he's plotting for a good chunk of the movie. He shows up intermittently as the first couple of acts are playing out doing cryptic stuff vaguely involving Hydra, and finally the third act converges on Zemo and why he's doing what he's doing, and it's about the simplest thing: vengeance. It's incredible to watch this ordinary man - no powers or abilities - just a smart, patient man, have a conceivable shot at destroying the Avengers. And the actor is excellent too. It's a nice change of pace from the invincible demigods and dull dark elves we've been getting in previous installments.\n\nCivil War is an expertly made film all around. The acting is top notch as always, the directing and the writing are masterful, I can go on and on. It's a political, personal, and powerfully conveyed story with tons of popcorn blockbuster appeal, rivaled only by The Winter Soldier in the MCU. Highly recommended.",

        "reviewText": "Since it is increasingly important in these reviews to appeal to all readers, and not offend anyone, I am offering two reviews. Simply pick the one you like.\n\n1. Great Production Values, Two and a Half Hours of Action, Whats Not to Like?\n\nThis, the shorter review, simply states the obvious. Marvel is getting progressively better at delivering action and most people today go to these films for the action, so this is win-win. Yeah. Everyone smile and wait for the next Marvel release. Have your wallets ready.\n\n2. As Marvel increasingly monopolizes the Superhero space, the themes get darker and darker.\n\nThe early 1920s believe it or not were a lot like today. Everyone sensed a growing unease in the collective gestalt, so they compensated by more partying, less critical thinking, and going to more movies. Interestingly, movies both before and after the Great Depression offered pure escapist entertainment. You went to the movies to get anything BUT reality.\n\nA century later, that paradigm has shifted. Ever since the \"graphic novels\" started to tackle serious adult themes, there seems to be a race among superhero writers to see who can put his (her) hero through the most angst, and drag the audience along for the ride.\n\nI am not sure this is a good thing but I seem to be in the minority. I have seen a Spiderman movie where Spidey's main squeeze was killed because Spidey was a few seconds late. I have seen Superman movies where the main goal seems to be to discover how many buildings you can smash with Superman's head. And now, picking up on the same thread, I am seeing Avenger movies where governments -- these would be the same governments spying on your emails and trying to ban cash -- are trying to tell the \"enhanced\" humans what to do and not do.\n\nNow, the suits at the studio would argue this must be what the audience wants because they are making money. This reviewer would argue that when you have a monopoly on a product line that people want, they will see it regardless. Only one of us is right.\n\nIn my view, the best superhero films are the ones that are the most humanistic. Superman comes out of a coma to be with the child he did not know he had. Iron Man rewards a boy who helped him when no one else would. Hulk drops out of an airplane not knowing if he will change or not, but he has to stop the bad guy and protect Betty.\n\nMy attitude is, if I want adult themes that badly I don't need to go the theatre, I can simply try to renew my license or wait in a hospital emergency room. I \"get\" this is how they are making superhero films these days. I suggest that in a year or two someone will rediscover the older, more sentimental, story lines, the audience will love it, and people of the future will look back at the films of today and wonder, what were they smoking?\n\nComment added 2021 -- With hindsight, the last \"legit\" Avengers movie before the suits decided to burn all the old franchises to the ground and go politically correct, and non-binary. A piece of history.",

      "text": "In 1991, Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), brainwashed to be the Winter Soldier, causes a car to crash and recovers bags of a serum that turns people into super soldiers.\n\nAfter the Avengers defeated Ultron, Thor and Hulk are nowhere to be found. Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) has gone home to spend time with his family. Even Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) has apparently disengaged. Captain America (Chris Evans) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) are leading a new team of Avengers, consisting of Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Vision (Paul Bettany), War Machine (Don Cheadle) and Falcon (Anthony Mackie). But the world hasn't forgotten the numerous civilian casualties that resulted from the Avengers' previous missions.\n\nIn Lagos, Nigeria, the team is tracking the movements of Brock Rumlow (Frank Grillo), a Hydra agent who had infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D. until Captain America exposed him. Brock was on one of the three Helicarriers that Cap had caused to fire on each other over the Triskelion near Washington DC, and he managed to survive the resulting crash. Badly burned in the incident, he now he wears a skull mask and goes by the name Crossbones. In Lagos, Crossbones and his team of mercenaries ram a garbage truck into the Institute for Infectious Disease building and clear out the guards with smoke canisters. Crossbones uses hydraulic gauntlets to give him super strength, and pounds open the glass around the lab. He grabs a vial containing a deadly, highly contagious virus. Cap's team takes out some of the mercenaries, and Crossbones and the rest of the men make their escape in a truck. After a chase, the truck is taken out of action. Crossbones hands the vial to one of his men, and tells them all to scatter. He then engages Cap, repeatedly punching him with enhanced strength, while the rest of the team chases after the mercenaries. Falcon finds the one holding the vial and shoots him, with Black Widow grabbing the vial before it hits the ground. Cap gets the upper hand on Crossbones, pinning him against the wall. Crossbones tells him that Bucky Barnes remembers him. With Cap momentarily distracted, Crossbones pushes a button, triggering a bomb on his vest. Cap braces himself, but Scarlet Witch is able to contain the force of the explosion. She uses her powers to push it up into the air, but she's only able to elevate it a bit before she loses control, and the explosion rips into the seventh floor of a nearby hotel. Cap calls for fire and rescue, and then runs into the building to help evacuate. Wanda tearfully looks at the destruction, devastated at her misguided actions.\n\nIn a theater inside Tony Stark's old college, a holographic video plays of him and his parents, Howard (John Slattery) and Maria. At the end, Tony tells the students that he is starting the Howard and Maria Stark Foundation, and each one of them has been approved for a research grant. In a corridor, a woman confronts him and shows him a picture of her son, who had been killed in Sokovia, crushed by a building that the Avengers had knocked down.\n\nAt the Avengers' headquarters, the team is watching news footage of the Lagos mission. The reporter says that eleven people were killed in the hotel. Steve tells them that he let his guard down, and people died because of it. Vision tells Steve that Tony has arrived, and he brought the Secretary of State as a guest, General Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt). Ross had been involved in the experiment that turned Bruce Banner into the Hulk, and then had spent years trying to hunt him down. Ross tells them that some people look up to them as heroes, but others think they're vigilantes. He shows pictures of the destruction that follows the team wherever they go, emphasizing the Sokovia incident. He sets a thick document down on the table and tells them it's the Sokovia Accords, ratified by 117 countries. The accords state that the Avengers will operate under a panel's supervision, only acting when the panel decides it's necessary. He says there will be a meeting in Vienna in three days, and if they don't sign on, they'll have to retire.\n\nThe team spends hours debating whether to agree to the accords, and Tony shows them all a picture of the boy who was killed in Sokovia. Steve asks what will happen if there's somewhere they need to go but the panel won't allow them. Tony replies that if they don't agree to this now, it will be forced on them later. Knowing that they've reached a stalemate, Steve leaves in disgust. He gets a message that Peggy Carter has died and attends her funeral in London. At the memorial service, SHIELD Agent 13 (Emily VanCamp) reveals during her eulogy that she's Carter's niece, Sharon. She and Steve share a moment after the service where it's hinted that they are romantically attracted to each other but they need to keep their friendship professional. The next day, Natasha finds Steve and tells him that she, Tony, James Rhodes and Vision had signed on, with Clint and Wanda holding out.\n\nIn Vienna, several heads of state have gathered for the ratification of the accords. Natasha meets the prince of Wakanda, T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), and his father, King T'Chaka (John Kani). Wakanda had become abundant in vibranium, the material that was used to make Captain America's shield, after a meteorite crashed there. Additionally, some of the Lagos victims were from Wakanda. King T'Chaka takes the podium for the keynote address, and Natasha notices security personnel surrounding a van parked outside. An explosion rips through the building, killing the king.\n\nBack in the U.S., Steve is sitting in a hotel room with Sam and Sharon Carter when a news report comes in, showing the destruction in Vienna. Security footage shows the man who planted the bomb, and Steve realizes that it's Bucky. Sharon gets a text, and tells Steve that she has to go to work, and takes a military plane to Vienna. Natasha looks around and sees hundreds of injured people. Prince T'Challa picks up a printed photo showing Bucky leaving the van that had the bomb. Natasha calls Steve, and he tells her that he has to be the one to bring in Bucky. He hangs up and looks at the damaged building, having already arrived in Vienna. Sharon sees him, and she hands him a file so he can get a head start on the manhunt, ahead of a German military task force, GSG9, who have orders to shoot to kill.\n\nIn Bucharest, Bucky picks up a newspaper and sees that he is being accused of the bombing in Vienna. He realizes that he'll have to leave quickly. Steve goes to Bucky's apartment and finds him there. The GSG9 storm in, and Bucky blocks their bullets with Cap's shield and the two fight them off. He jumps down to the street, where he is confronted by the Black Panther, who scrapes his armor with metal claws on his hands. Cap jumps down and lands next to them, and all three take fire from the GSG9. Cap and Bucky run for cover, but the Black Panther stands still, letting the bullets hit him and bounce off harmlessly. Bucky runs through the streets with Black Panther chasing him, and Cap and Falcon following the Panther. Cap commandeers a GSG9 SUV, while the Panther leaps from the top of one car to the next, steadily gaining on Bucky. Bucky knocks a man off a motorcycle, then jumps on himself and guns the engine, driving into a tunnel. Black Panther is still tirelessly giving chase. Cap drives the SUV near Bucky's motorcycle, and the Panther jumps onto the SUV's roof, and then onto the back of the motorcycle. Bucky swings backward, knocking the Panther off, but he sticks his claws into the side of the SUV and clings to its side. Bucky looks ahead and sees Falcon flying straight toward him. He hits the brakes, and turns the motorcycle around and drives back past the SUV. Cap throws it into reverse, trying to keep up with Bucky. The Panther jumps into the air, and lands on Falcon's wings. Bucky takes a metal ball and throws it up to the roof of the tunnel. It explodes, blowing a hole in the concrete. Falcon uses his wings to shield himself, throwing off the Panther, who went straight through the explosion, unharmed. Bucky swerves to avoid a car, and falls off the bike. The Panther jumps on him, swinging his claws at him. Cap tackles the Panther, and they trade blows, with the Panther's claws leaving gashes in Cap's shield. War Machine flies in through the hole, and the GSG9 surrounds them all and tells them to put their hands up. They are all arrested, and Black Panther removes his mask, revealing himself as Prince T'Challa of Wakanda.\n\nOn the ride to the task force headquarters in Berlin, Cap tells the prince that he has the wrong man. Cap, Falcon and the prince get out, and in another truck, Bucky is taken out in a cage. They are met by Everett Ross (Martin Freeman), the leader of the headquarters. The men have their weapons removed, and they are led inside the building, where Black Widow is waiting for them. Everett takes Prince T'Challa into one room, and the others are led to another room, where Tony tells them that Secretary Ross wants to have them all prosecuted. Tony says that as a compromise, they won't get back the shield and wings, which are now government property.\n\nT'Challa uses his influence to have Bucky extradited to Wakanda, where he will face charges of terrorism. Bucky is given an evaluation to determine his mental state. Still in the room with Tony, Cap watches it unfold. Tony tells him that if he signs the accords now, Bucky will be transferred to an American psych facility instead of a Wakandan jail. Steve agrees, but only if safeguards are put into place. Tony brightens, telling Steve that he and Wanda will be reinstated. Steve asks what he means about Wanda, and he tells Steve that she is being confined to the Avengers' upstate New York facility, under the guard of Vision. Tony says it's the best he can do, since she's not a U.S. citizen and they won't give her a visa. Steve says that she's only a kid, and doesn't deserve to be imprisoned. He leaves without signing onto the accords.\n\nHawkeye breaks into the facility where Vision is holding Scarlet Witch. He attacks Vision, but is unable to hurt or subdue him. Scarlet Witch uses her powers to force Vision through the floor and down several levels, and she and Hawkeye escape.\n\nColonel Zemo (Daniel Br√ºhl), having already killed a Hydra agent and recovered a book containing a list of words that will trigger Bucky's reversion to his brainwashed state, infiltrates the compound as the psychiatrist who will evaluate Bucky and reads off the list. Bucky, recognizing the trigger list, is helpless to stop Zemo and pounds his way out of his cell, battling Stark, Cap, Natasha and T'Challa. He tries to escape in a helicopter on the roof but is stopped by Rogers, who forces the chopper to fall into the river. He rescues his friend and takes him to a safe house where he and Sam Wilson clamp Bucky's bionic arm in an industrial press. Regaining his senses, Bucky tells Steve that Zemo is going to Siberia, where there are several more super soldiers waiting for someone to wake them up and give them a mission.\n\nCap assembles a team consisting of Bucky, Falcon, Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch and Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) to stop Zemo. By operating outside of authority, they all become renegades. Iron Man forms his own team, made up of War Machine, Black Panther, Black Widow, Vision and Spider-Man (Tom Holland) to arrest the others. Two teams meet at the airport in Leipzig, Germany. Cap's plan involves stealing the Quinjet some members of the other team arrived in. Stark tries to appeal to Rogers but fails and a pitched battle breaks out. Stark insists that Peter Parker remain at a distance and use his webbing to subdue anyone he can. Black Panther intends to capture Bucky. Ant-Man enlarges himself to 80 feet in height, distracting Stark's team and buying time for Cap and Bucky to escape to the hangar with the Quinjet. Black Widow appears intent on stopping them, but she turns on Black Panther, allowing Cap and Bucky to fly off in the Quinjet. War Machine tries to stop them from escaping, but Falcon flies after him. Tony orders Vision to stop Falcon, Vision shoots an energy beam from the Mind Stone which Falcon dodges and hits War Machine's arc reactor instead, disabling his armor's functions, causing him to fall from the sky and impact the ground before either Falcon or Stark can reach him. Stark finds that Rhodes is barely alive. When Falcon tries to express his sympathy, Tony knocks him out with a repulsor blast.\n\nAfter seeing evidence that Bucky was framed for the Vienna explosion, Iron Man travels to The Raft, a remote Arctic prison facility where the other members of Cap's team are incarcerated under the supervision of Secretary Ross. Tony is able to temporarily block the audio surveillance system of the facility long enough to show Sam that Rogers was right and that Zemo had killed the psychiatrist who was supposed to evaluate Bucky. He is able to find out from Sam Wilson where Rogers and Bucky went. Tony boards his private chopper and slips out in his Iron Man armor, travelling to Siberia to meet up with Cap and Bucky and make peace.\n\nOnce Tony finds Bucky and Capt, they find that the super soldiers have already been killed, and Zemo, hidden behind indestructible glass, reveals that his real plan was to find footage of the Winter Soldier's first mission. Black Panther had been following, unseen, and he hears Zemo admit responsibility for the explosion. Zemo shows them a videotape of Bucky causing the car crash, and then murdering the occupants, Howard and Maria Stark, in cold blood.\n\nIncensed, Iron Man attacks both Cap and Bucky, and he demands to know if Steve knew what had happened. Steve tells him that he only knew that Hydra was behind his parents' murder. They fight, and Iron Man blasts off Bucky's metal arm. Cap eventually disables Tony's arc reactor, rendering his suit useless. Tony tells him that he doesn't deserve to carry his shield that his father gave to Steve. Steve drops it and leaves with Bucky. Panther finds Zemo sitting outside, looking at a photograph and holding a pistol. He tells Black Panther that his family was killed in Sokovia, and he wouldn't stop until he destroyed the Avengers from within. With his success, Zemo tries to commit suicide with the pistol, but Black Panther places his hand over the barrel, stopping the bullet, and apprehends Zemo for judgment.\n\nTony is helping Rhodes with his recovery, giving him robotic leg braces to recover from paralysis. He receives a package from Rogers -- the FedEx delivery guy (a cameo by Stan Lee) mispronouncing his name as \"Tony Stank\", much to the amusement of the recovering Rhodey -- that contains an flip-model cell phone and a note saying Tony can call Steve if he and the world face any new threats. At the Raft, Steve breaks the heroes out and they go to Wakanda, where T'Challa gives them asylum. Bucky elects to be put back into cryogenic sleep until they can find a way to cure his brainwashing, so that no one will be able to manipulate him again. Peter Parker is recovering from his injuries at home -- telling May that he got into a fight at school with a guy named \"Steve\" -- and he tries out a new version of the web shooter that Tony gave him. To his fascination, it projects the Spidey signal onto the ceiling."

        "reviewText": "CAPTAIN MARVEL is the latest Marvel comics offering and the follow-up to AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR; inevitably it's a big step down from the success of that movie. This one goes down a much more predictable route, and it suffers hugely from having a main character who simply isn't very interesting; like Superman, her immortality and strength make her rather boring to see on screen. The film also suffers from having an unimposing villain, a crucial climactic scene openly copying RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, and generic action. On the plus side: there's a nice supporting turn from a funny and de-aged Samuel L. Jackson; the material on Earth is gently amusing, riffing on the buddy-buddy genre; there's a solid and major plot twist halfway through that really works; and Brie Larson is a decent actress. But they really need to think of something more involved next time instead of this generic amnesic hero stuff.",

Visiting the oldest working cinema in the UK (The Electric) I found a flick with a run time that would give me just enough time to catch the train home,so I get set to see the new captain of the MCU.\n\nView on the film:\n\nWhilst facially de-aged with seamless CGI,Samuel (yel)L. Jackson swaggers with a coolness that has not aged one bit, with Jackson hitting Fury's comedic punch-lines with a smooth as silk ease. The first woman superhero in the Disney Marvel films to have her own solo movie, Brie Larson brings out the heroic in Marvel's passion to save the Skrulls, but fails to fly to a super height in the comedic,and establishment of her own origins,as Larson delivers punch lines with a stilted awkwardness which allows Jackson (who has worked with Larson three times) to outshine her in the jokes, and Larson also keeps a cold distance from giving Marvel the enthusiasm other superheros have when using their powers.\n\nDesigned as a origin for Captain Marvel, the writers visibly show more interest in the side characters than they do in lead, with the plight of the Skrulls bringing a heart and urgency to the mission, which drifts away in the mid-section that focuses on Marvel's dry beginnings. Dipping into the Dr Strange-style fantastical with a striking sequence of Marvel fighting her inner turmoil, co-directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck are joined by cinematographer Ben Davis in largely skipping over the enticing fantastical (save for a cute cat) to deliver slick Marvel Comics action set-pieces and Star Wars-inspired space ship races, wrapped in a catchy 90's soundtrack leaving No Doubt on Captain Marvel's powers.",

It was packed full of drama, suspense, humor, tears, and fight scenes, oh, the fight scenes! I guess I should say it has all the feels. I'm not giving anything away, but if you enjoy the trailers, you have NO IDEA what you're in store for. Each character brought a certain aspect to the storyline that was phenomenal. I especially loved the seasoned agents, we know and love, being aged backwards for this jam packed 90s film. And can we talk about that soundtrack, along with 90s gear? Talk about nostalgia! But in all, Marvel Studios did not disappoint yet again! I'm beyond pumped that they finally brought a woman superhero into the mix as the lead role. Like normal Marvel fashion, there's an after credits scene, AND an after-after credits scene. So be sure to stick around to watch. Lastly, Goose is the real MVP of Captain Marvel. üêà",

        "reviewText": "I was left with the general feeling, that \"Captain Marvel\" is a major disappointment.\n\nFirst of all, there is a good story here somewhere, but it's just not well told, and there's too much of it crammed within about 115 minutes. The movie is fast-paced, but never really works, because the pacing is flat and timing is off. Aesthetically, \"Captain Marvel\" has been processed through the same \"Marvel filter\" as the rest of them. Dull. The filmmakers (indie directors of the great \"Half Nelson\") have given absolutely no attention to the music: the score is completely forgettable as are the 90's songs.\n\nAs for the themes, the MGTOW people are going to have a field day with \"Captain Marvel's\" less than subtle \"feminist agenda\". I'm putting that in quotations, because it's more accurately described as simply female agenda. Which is absolutely fine and commendable; the problem is the infantile in-your-face way the filmmakers address the theme. The movie is set in the year 1995, and it really feels made for that year's audience. \"Captain Marvel\" lacks a fresh perspective. And, by the way, any fans of \"Buffy, The Vampire Slayer\" will immediately recognise one pivotal scene lifted from a truly powerful scene in the series finale. In any case, Carol Danvers of the comics was always a decidedly feminist character, so this shouldn't cause any waves. What's lacking, is Carol's wide array of problems: her character history in the comics is one of the craziest in the Marvel universe (which is saying something.). Movie's much simpler.\n\nThe biggest disappointment, however, is the resourceful Brie Larson. She's just off. I don't know what happened, but the brilliant actress from \"Room\" is nowhere to be seen. She was just the wrong choice, I guess. Still, I'm surprised by her lackluster-ness. The cast isn't great, anyways, but at least Samuel L. Jackson and Ben Mendelsohn seem to be having fun.\n\nUnlike me, for the most part.",

Oh, this was so forgettable...\n\nWell, one thing is for sure, the film is about CGI. Yup, a typical Hollywood display of the latest in movie making: sitting behind a desk and adding everything on computer. Wow, there's A LOT of CGI here. Where do I even begin with how much I disliked this film? The most obvious, I suppose: Brie Larson as Captain Marvel. This was the most wood-faced, lifeless superhero I've seen like ever. There's absolutely no enthusiasm here. As if Larson didn't want to make the film, but needed the paycheck. \"Let me say my lines and get it over with.\" - Yeah, that's the feeling I got.\n\nThe film is too fantastical in its entirety to be taken seriously. Now add a bunch of irritating characters, and your typical Hollywood humor, and voila! - Captain Marvel. Yawn, I was so bored during this movie. I tried looking beyond all the CGI and annoying elements to find a deeper meaning here, but alas, it was plastered so thick with an incomprehensible plot that I just couldn't enjoy it - no matter how hard I tried. I was literally counting the minutes to the ending. Oh, and note the town Mar-Velle... oh, how unoriginal, Marvel!\n\nThe ending was pure WTF!!! What were the writers smoking when they wrote this??? Judging by Nick Fury's character, I presume this to be a prequel to the dozen or so other superhero movies featuring this character. The ending screams for a sequel ...and no doubt there will be a few... yawn.",

The movie is definitely more on the light side and humorous than action packed, however, it keeps one engaged and entertained. Can't wait for Endgame!! And still wishing/believing that DC will get it right eventually.",

        "reviewText": "This is a very controversial Marvel film. Which seems to be a running trend with Disney films recently. The hype around this film seems to be very mixed, some want it to succeed and some want it to fail, and both sides seem to have these viewpoints due to various political reasons. There seems to be a lot of agendas involved. I do not have any stake in either side because I do not care about this kind of thing when it comes to film. I don't think it's fair to judge films from that perspective in a positive or negative way. In the same sense that I don't think it's fair to judge a film from a positive or negative perspective based on whether or not you like the actors involved. I don't care if films succeed or fail financially. Film is an art form to me and I just want to see films that are well-made by people who have a lot of passion for their craft.\n\n To start with things I liked, there's some spurts of entertainment that come from this film. Some fun action scenes, the chemistry between Brie Larson and Samuel Jackson was very on point. The de-aging effects for Samuel Jackson and Clark Gregg were surprisingly great. The first act overall was relatively enjoyable, especially the opening action scene. The music/score was pretty good. And the cat was a fun addition. But overall the film was very bland and disappointing.\n\n Honestly, I was hoping for better. To me a superhero movie needs to have an interesting story, well developed characters, and it needs to grab me and make me care about what's going on. This applies to film in general. One of the saddest things about this film that I was genuinely hoping I wouldn't have to say is that I don't think Brie Larson did a good job in this film. Brie Larson is an incredibly talented actress so I don't necessarily think she's to blame for that, it might have just been the poor material she was given to work with. As the film progresses she gets increasingly more stoic, and the film never showcases any emotion or vulnerability towards the character for some reason. And her character is given almost all backstory with too much exposition and very little depth. And at the same time there isn't enough given to make you care about her or any of the characters. Overall I don't think she fit the character, the performance was very wooden and uneven. Which is sad to say because you can tell how much passion she's giving towards this character.\n\n The narrative is so scattered that she kind of gets lost in the shuffle & they forget to develop her character. Which was disappointing for me. The storytelling was very messy. This film is trying to be an origin story, a connecting piece to the past as well as to what's going on now, and a set up film for what's to come later. So the film kind of collapsed in on itself because it's trying to do too many things at once.\n\n This honestly felt like Phase 1, which is not a good thing. That's not to say that Iron Man and The Avengers weren't good, it's just that this film feels a lot like the early Marvel films in the sense that it felt like they were still in an experimental phase. They were still trying to figure out what works and what doesn't work about their films. They've passed that point and they know what works by now so this film as well as all the other new ones should be progressive steps forward, and this film was definitely a gigantic step backwards.\n\n They also don't do a good job making this character feel important or relevant to what's currently going on in the MCU. We're told she's the most powerful character in the MCU, but they never show us that or make us feel that way. The film is a lot of telling rather than showing. Needless to say the writing and directing were pretty lackluster. Also the action other than the opening was not very good or memorable at all.\n\n The Skrulls were fun villains, and relatively unique compared to other Marvel villains, but they weren't really given any character.\n\n There was a lot of fun 90s references but I think the film relies on this as a crutch way too much. Which caused the tone to be very disjointed. They have 90s nostalgia for a little bit, then it feels like a buddy cop film with Nick Fury, and then it's a story about the friendship between her and Lashana Lynch's character. And there's no effort given to make the audience feel emotionally invested in any of these stories. And since it's always jumping back and forth between these contrasting tones, and that made the film uneven as a result.\n\n There are some needless explanations for things that happen in the MCU and when they happened it felt corny and forced.\n\n The film was a fun time but this is the 21st Marvel Cinematic Universe film, so at this point generic fun action films are old and tired. And since there have been dozens of Marvel films at this point they need to live up to a higher standard. So in order for me to like their films at this point they have to do something more than just making a fun movie. I can't believe I'm saying this but DC did it better. Wonder Woman had charm, charisma, and character development. And I Captain Marvel definitely fell flat in this regard. Again, there are moments of potential here, but they are hiding under the bland cliched Marvel formula. It's a very generic film that we've seen many times before not just when it comes to superhero movies, and I was hoping for more than that. 5/10.\n\n Please see the film though and make up your own opinion on it. Don't listen to what others say, don't give in to online agendas no matter what side they're on. Just go see the film, make up your own mind, and when you do be honest about it, because that's how we get better films, by letting the filmmakers know what works and what doesn't work about their films.\n\n But at the end of the day the fact that this film didn't live up to its potential doesn't matter, and I'm still very excited because... \"We're in the Endgame now.\"",

Alas, in that regard Wonder Woman did a lot better as a movie as a whole.\n\nThe acting is not that great between Brie Larson's poor performance and the prosthetic/GCI on Samuel L. Jackson that makes him look younger but also gives him an expressionless wooden appearance. There are very obvious plot holes (like, wait, how did they know to do that?) and the pacing is very uneven; there are a few parts during which I didn't feel engaged at all.\n\nOn the plus side it does fairly well as an origin story, and there is that Marvel level of polish in special effects and editing. All in all, it might be a necessary introduction to Captain Marvel for Avengers End Game, but it is probably the weakest MCU movie to date.\n\nEDIT: 2 years later and I watched it a second time as part of my MCU chronological order marathon, and it is actually better than I originally felt. A lot of the above points still stand but I was a bit harsh because it didn't meet my expectations at the time. I now change my original 6/10 to a 7/10 as it's a fairly entertaining movie and is truly an essential part of the MCU saga leading to Endgame.",

        "reviewText": "About to end its phase 3 with an \"Ultimatum\", one of the most awaited films of the last decades, Marvel still finds time to introduce new and important characters in its shared universe. In the comics, Carol Danvers, Captain Marvel, debuted in the Silver Age of American comics. The character was featured in a solo series in the late 1970s, before associating with the superhero teams, The Avengers and X-Men, the character was created by screenwriter Roy Thomas and designer Gene Colan. Danvers first appeared as an officer in the United States Air Force and a colleague of superhero kree Mar-Vell in Marvel Super-Heroes # 13 (March 1968). In recent times, Danvers has been labeled \"Marvel's greatest heroine\" and \"possibly\" most powerful Marvel Avengers member. \" In theaters, \"Captain Marvel\", in addition to being the first Marvel film starring a heroine, is the bridge between \"Avengers: Infinity War\" and the long-awaited \"Avengers: Ultimatum\". Directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, and written by Geneva Robertson-Dworet, it stars Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn, Lashanna Lynch, Djimon Hounsou, Lee Pace, Mckenna Grace, Clark Gregg and Jude Law. takes us takes us to before all the other MCU features (except for Captain America: The First Avenger). In 1995, the story follows Danvers when she becomes Captain Marvel after Earth is caught in the center of a galactic conflict between two alien worlds, borrowing elements from screenplay writer Roy Kree-Skrull (1971). Thomas. For starters, the publisher's homage to his legendary comic artist Stan Lee stands out, putting him in the place of the characters he created in the opening animation of Marvel Studios. Lee passed away in late 2018 and, before that, he even recorded his famous participation in the film, appearing in the scene where the heroine hunts a Skrull in the subway. Exploring flashes of the past very well, the heroine tries to discover more about her own past, as well as understand and master her powers. Finally, the heroine manages to show a more human facet to the public through the partnership with Nick Fury that generates several situations of comedy that gives lightness to the war by showing it through Fury's still innocent eyes, and also with Maria Rambeau (Lashanna Lynch), which is the heroine's great connection to her past. It is in Maria's memories the memory of facing prejudices as pilots and in the support for the creation of little Monica Rambeau (Akira Akbar). But there are other characters who are doing very well and steal all the scenes they participate in: Talos (Ben Mendelsohn) and the cat Goose. Yon-Rogg (Jude Law) and Dr. Wendy Lawson / Supreme Intelligence (Annette Bening) are good assistants. Because it is a film that takes place decades ago, it is curious to see several of the characters that we get used to accompany, in another moment of life. Ronan the Accuser, who first appeared as the great villain of Guardians of the Galaxy and a lackey for Thanos, appears as the leader of an elite Kree force, the Accusers; Korath is just a Kree soldier; Agent Coulson appears as a young and promising agent and the main highlight is Nick Fury. At the time, he was an agent for S.H.I.E.L.D. who, after years as a spy, worked outside the field looking for ways to protect the Earth. He is still inexperienced and had no knowledge of intergalactic issues, let alone superpowered beings. Jackson and Gregg - who, among others, reprise their roles in previous MCU films - were digitally rejuvenated in post-production to reflect the setting of the film in the 90s. And the result couldn't be better: they are of an absurd quality, bordering on the perfection. One of the main aspects of the feature is the infinity of references not only in relation to the stories of the publisher's comics, but also in the pop culture of the 80s and 90s, where the story predominantly takes place. After escaping the Skrulls, Carol Danvers falls to Earth inside a Blockbuster video store. As the feature takes place in the 1990s, it is possible to see references to classics such as Hook: The Return of the Captain Hook (1991), Babe, the Rough Piggy (1995), True Lies (1994), in addition to The Elected: Where the Future Begins (1983). The musical references are also present, with several references of bands from the 80's and early 90's. She appears with a Guns N 'Roses T-shirt - and finds a ticket to the group's concert, a Bush poster appears when she is on the pay phone, Nine Inch Nails, Heart t-shirts appear, a Smashing Pumpkins poster and even a reference to grunge in the heroine's civilian outfits. Another reference is Captain Marvel's cat, which in the comics is called Chewie in a reference to Star Wars. In cinema, however, Marvel chose to call him Goose, a direct reference to Anthony Edwards' character in Top Gun: Untamed Aces. It is not, however, a conventional feline. Goose arrived on Earth with Mar-Vell and is an alien of the Flerken race, with internal tentacles and the ability to swallow objects as powerful as the Tesseract. In comics, the breed also has the ability to harbor dimensions within itself, being able to teleport from place to place, in addition to laying numerous eggs. In the film, aware of the threat of Flerken, the Kree gag the creature, in a moment inspired directly by the comics. The film also reveals how Nick Fury lost his eye - a scratch from Goose, and how theories emerged about how he came to use his famous eye patch, with Fury insisting on feeding the aura of mystery around the wound. There is also the fact that Fury was inspired by Danvers to propose to S.H.I.E.L.D. recruiting exceptional individuals to defend the Earth together from unconventional threats, and when he discovers that Danvers was codenamed \"Avenger\" in the Air Force, he names this protocol \"Avengers Initiative\". Although the film highlights the friend Maria Rambeau, we must pay attention to her daughter. Monica Rambeau in the comics is one of the most powerful heroines in the Marvel Universe, having even been the first woman to use the name Captain Marvel. In 1982, at Amazing Spider-Man Annual # 16, Marvel introduced Monica Rambeau at the hands of Roger Stern and John Romita Jr. as a New Orleans police officer who has the power to transform into any form of energy. As Captain Marvel, she was a member of the Avengers and even led the team. Then he adopted the name Photon (which in the film appears as Maria's nickname in the air force, as shown in the photo above), Pulsar and currently serves as Spectrum. As the film takes place in the 90s, M√¥nica is around 30 years old in the present line of the MCU. However, the film is not just a nostalgic trip and it has different points. Perhaps due to their lack of experience in running large blockbusters, the duo of directors are unable to shoot action scenes that look spectacular. The prevalence of more closed plans and not so imposing scenarios, fail to give the scenes greater proportions as they should. The feeling is that in the hands of another director, the scenes could be reimagined in the way that worked best on the big screen. In addition to not being grandiose, the scenes are scarce, being almost all restricted to the final act of the story, and were also not helped in many moments by the visual effects team. In several scenes, it is possible to notice the use of CGI in the composition of scenarios, giving an air of artificiality, especially in the final stretch when the heroine fights aerial fights with her powers developed. The rhythm of the film is a problem with the plot starting relatively at a slower pace, taking time to explain the central conflict - deeper than it appears - and, of course, the protagonist's role in this story. So, gradually, Captain Marvel gains a more intense cadence and it is in her arrival on Earth that the film actually begins to take a more defined form. There is also the issue of the Skrull-Kree war, which is summed up in a very simplistic and incoherent way. We have a little war. In the film, everything is very predictable. From the beginning, one feels that nothing is as it seems, and the real villains can be identified with a mere guessing exercise. However, it is the lack of personality of the antagonists, generic in their plans and worldview, that damage the plot more deeply. Seeing this weak antagonism after figures like Killmonger and especially Thanos is, to say the least, something that lowers the experience to a B or C series within this recent crop. Long before she was Captain Marvel, Carol was a fearless girl finding her place in a world of men. As a human, she has flaws, but whenever she fell, she got up, tried herself and got everything she wanted. A child, a teenager, a young adult. The transformation into Kree would be the starting point for the character, if her entire past no longer assumed a hero's journey. The feminist subtext, although well implemented, does not reach the depth that racial and cultural themes gained in the film of the hero of Wakanda. And you don't even have to reach it. Issues can be raised for discussion without becoming flags blindly defended by a particular group. Overall, the film follows the late Marvel formula and does not take chances, does not innovate and does not dare, but delivers a fun, nostalgic result and a character that will certainly be one of the leaders of The Avengers in the next films!",

        "reviewText": "One major thing that people have said is that this film is great for \"Phase One\" of the MCU and that is absolutely true. The more recent films in this universe either raises the stakes for these heroes, adds more depth to them or does something unique to make it very worth watching. Although, I did enjoy it and want to see more of this character, this film didn't do anything to actually WOW me in any sort of way.\n\nThere weren't any cool shots or standout scenes, even though I did enjoy all of the superhero stuff. The moment Captain Marvel uses her powers and starts using her abilities, we understand that she is a big deal and can be a huge asset for the heroes of Earth. Sadly, the characters didn't have enough personality for them to be memorable. For the most part, the plot is interesting by handling Carol Denvers adventure in rediscovering who she is and finding her place in this world, but I thought the execution could have been handled more carefully as the film did have some potential to go deeper with the characters. There was never that spark or flare that I've loved to see in an origin film and felt a little bit bland compared to the others. The characters that we have seen before, such as Nick Fury, is always nice to see as he and Denvers had good chemistry and provided a lot of the humor together. Excluding a few of the new characters, the rest were uninteresting and kind of had nothing to do.\n\nPeople do complain about Brie Larson and I thought she did fine here. She was able to bring a sense of personality to the character and although she isn't as interesting as the other characters in the MCU, Larson did the best with what she was given. Samuel L. Jackson is always great as Nick Fury and I'm glad we've got more screen time with him as this film provides as a prequel and we get to know who he is as a character. He brings in the humor and liked every single moment with him. One major plus is the special effects team by making him look so much younger, there was never a time where I noticed that it was fake. Ben Mendelsohn is actually pretty good here and I liked all they did with his character. One actor I'm actually disappointed in and not because of he was bad, but because he had nothing to do was Jude Law. I wanted to see more Jude Law here and if they film was able to put him more to build a bond and relationship between his character and Larson's, then it would have made his character even more interesting.\n\nThe stuff that happens on Earth is easily the best part of the film as it was able to bring the comedy and entertainment. However, I wished that the film focuses more on the Star Force team which would have helped add more tension and conflict throughout the film. Some of them do appear in other films and it had potential for us to get to know them. Instead, we only get a glimpse of these soldiers and do not have any sort of understanding of who they are and not being able to connect with them. After the first act, they disappear and appear again for the climax in which wasn't executed well as I don't remember their names or their abilities.\n\nOne thing that I did like was that the movie had a few twists that surprised me. I expected things to happen a certain way based on discussions I had about the characters and based on the trailer only to have the film to do something unexpectedly. The pacing and the overall story is still fun to watch, but because of the caliber of the previous films, it just feels weaker than usual. Also, one final remark, all of this talk and \"controversy\" I never had a single moment of Marvel bringing in politics to cinema. I have talked to some people who did not like parts of the film due to the fact that they believed the agenda that Marvel was trying to push. You see what you want to see and I saw a decent, but flawed superhero flick that is enjoyable to watch.",

        "reviewText": "I don't want to adress the hate, but let's try to forget it for a second and just appreciate the film for what it is: a film. thank you.\n\nFirst of all, the intro of the mcu logo was great. youll see what i mean when you see the film and I appreciate the creators for doing it as they did.\n\nNow... first the good stuff: 1. Samuel L. Jackson: He played a more softened Nick Fury, but very much \"agent coulson prior avengers\" like, with a lot of attitude, sarcastic humor and less serious. Also the de-aging is becoming so good, that you wouldnt even be able to notice it even if you really looked. His character was very well done on script and screen.\n\n2. Some of the action: The space battle stuff etc. was very well done. the special effects team did an amazing job at this movie. nothing felt or looked fake. kudos!\n\n3. Surprise surprise: the story. From the trailers you would not be able to predict this but the story is actually really interesting. The way they introduce her past was very originally done. The way she remembers things through different ways was clever.. very clever even, because it doesnt make her past like an obstacle you first gotta go through.. it added to the story while adding to her character. Also multiple twist and 1 big one that even got me thinking for a while.\n\n4. Ben Mendelson: really impressive job. very layered surpringsly and stand out in my books. the acting is general was very good\n\nthe bad:\n\n1. It misses spectacle... and a standout moment. in thor 3 for example; you had the intro scene, and the end scene which were big standout moments and a manifestation of thor's powers. i feel you didnt get that in this movie.\n\n2. Like I said the story was great, the execution a.k.a. the screenplay/script lacked... they had such great storypoints, but they were all done so quickly and those moments lacked emotion. the friendship between carol and her friend didnt feel real. she seemed to have a more genuine relationship with her kid rather than with her and that bothered me a bit, since they seemed all buddy buddy in the past and even during some moments in the film where i was like; \"but you didnt deserve that yet...\" Ben's character had a more emotional impact on me than carol... yikes!! (and i dont mean that in a killmonger-t'challa kind of way)\n\n3. some of the action again: some action just wasn't good. there is a moment she is fighting the skrull(the moment she yells at the skrull in the trailer) and that whole fighting sequence was horribly filmed and choreographed... which is weird, because she another scene where she is fighting the skrull in the film and then the action seemed way better filmed.\n\nAll in all, the film was good. nothing more and nothing less. i missed an emotional attachment to the main character. I felt like i still didnt know her after the film, and i think that's because they tried to give her a certain personality that just didnt fit the film. she was supposed to be a bit arrogant, but i wouldve loved to see more vulnerablity in a woman that is the STRONGEST creature in the world and they made me believe that btw. she come across as amazingly powerfull at one point in the film. believe me! Wonderwoman's vulnerability and her femine side me fall in love with the character and they stripped that away fromm carol, and basically made her less relatable.\n\nso that's why i gave it a 7. it's definitely a good time in the theatre and some of the scenes are quite the spectacle and i loved the shock and awe that some scenes provided. especially the way she got her powers(hihihi geeks out). Go see it. it is nowhere near as bad as iron man 2/thor 2, but it doesn't touch civil war, infinity war etc. either, its like rifght in the middle. inbetween those 20+ films.",

It's one of the weaker Marvel films to be sure ... but I thought the AntMans or Thor 2 were both far weaker and I liked this one more than Black Panther. I loved Brie Larson, I loved her character, and it was AWESOME to finally see a truly badass female superhero. Like truly badass ... like I-wanna-see-Captain-Marvel-vs-Superman-cuz-I-think-she-could-take-him badass. It's about freaking time!\n\nAMAZING soundtrack ... all the 90's stuff was really fun (especially if you were alive during the 90's) and there were several laugh out loud moments. Was it super cornball at times ... sure. Were some of the \"reveals\" kinda hooky? Absolutely. But this was overall a solid, fun, film. My husband and I both left the theater smiling.\n\nHaters need to get a life.",

      "text": "In 1995, on the Kree Empire's capital planet of Hala, warrior and Starforce member Vers suffers from recurring nightmares involving an older woman. Yon-Rogg, her mentor and commander, warns her to control her abilities while the Supreme Intelligence, an organic artificial intelligence who acts as the ruler of the Kree, urges her to keep her emotions in check.\n\nWhile working with official Ronan the Accuser to rescue an undercover spy, Vers is abducted and subjected to a memory probe by a group of Skrulls, alien shapeshifters with whom the Kree Empire is at war. Vers escapes and, after leaving the Skrulls' ship in an escape pod, crash lands on Earth. Her presence attracts the attention of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Nick Fury and Phil Coulson, whose investigation is interrupted by a Skrull attack. In the ensuing chase, Vers recovers a crystal containing her memories and Fury kills a Skrull impersonating Coulson. Fury later meets and agrees to work with Vers while Skrull commander Talos disguises himself as S.H.I.E.L.D. operative Keller.\n\nUsing Fury's security clearance, Vers learns she was a pilot who is presumed to have died six years earlier while testing an experimental light-speed engine designed by scientist Wendy Lawson, who she recognizes as the woman from her nightmares. The two escape after \"Keller\" confronts them, with Lawson's cat Goose stowing away, and pilot a small cargo jet to Louisiana. A meeting with felllow pilot Maria Rambeau and her young daughter Monica reveals Vers' real name is Carol Danvers.\n\nTalos, who had tracked her, arrives and asks to speak. Using the black-box recorder of Lawson's crashed plane, Danvers learns an alien spaceship had shot it down - and she now remembers Yon-Rogg killing Lawson, as well as Lawson's warning that the experimental engine's energy-core had to be destroyed to keep it from the wrong hands. Vers shot it and was caught in an ensuing explosion, with her body absorbing the energy. Yon-Rogg brought the amnesiac \"Vers\" - the remaining portion of \"Danvers\" on her broken dog tag - to Hala.\n\nTalos explains the Skrulls are simply refugees, and Lawson's engine was to help them escape beyond Kree reach. Using coordinates Lawson had given Danvers, she, along with Fury, Monica, and Goose - who for some reason terrifies Talos - fly their Skrull-modified cargo jet to a cloaked ship in orbit. There they find the source of the energy-core's power, the Tesseract - and some Skrull refugees, including Talos' mate and child. Yon-Rogg's Starforce, having tracked them, captures Danvers and places her in VR before the Supreme Intelligence. Enraged at being used, Danvers fights back, and discovers that a Kree implant that purportedly gave her Kree powers was instead limiting them.\n\nAccessing her full force, Danvers escapes, gives the Tesseract to Fury for safekeeping, and battles the Starforce to give Rambeau time to fly herself, Fury, and the Skrulls to Earth - along with Goose, who is not a cat but an alien known as a Flerken that can sprout powerful tentacles and whose insides are a pocket dimension where the Tesseract is placed. Rambeau shoots down a pursuing Minn-Erva. Danvers chases an escaping Yon-Rogg and discovers the extent of her powers, including flight. She singlehandedly destroys multiple ballistic missiles that Ronan, called in by Yon-Rogg, has fired at Earth, and forces Ronan's forces to retreat. On Earth, Danvers quickly defeats Yon-Rogg and sends him back to Hala with a warning to the Supreme Intelligence.\n\nDanvers agrees to help the Skrulls find a new homeworld, giving Fury a modified pager with which to contact her in an emergency. Fury later drafts a proposal for an initiative, changing the name after finding a photo with Danvers' old call sign of \"Avenger\".\n\nIn a present-day mid-credits scene: Danvers meets Avengers Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, Bruce Banner, and James Rhodes, who were monitoring the pager Fury had activated.\n\nIn an end-credits flashback, Goose coughs up the Tesseract."

        "reviewText": "Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) is the best Marvel comic book Action Superhero movie and one of my favorite films of The Avengers! Big, busy and action-packed - like the first movie, but with better pacing. It is a huge improvement over Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) I am sorry but I don't think Joe Johnston is making a good films. He even screwed up my favorite film Jurassic Park III. Great movie! I didn't like the first Captain America but I LOVE this one. Great acting, great story, great action, great EVERYTHING. Marvel Studios continues to improve upon and expand this superhero universe and it shows with Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The action is turned up, the performances are top notch, plus with the addition of Robert Redford raises the bar yet again. Chris Evans certainly owns this role know just as Downey owns Tony Stark. \n\nI LOVE LOVE LOVED the Iron Man trilogy. There are lots of great intrigue moments, though I think some of the biggest \"plot points\" on this one were spoiled thanks to the marketing and broader fan base knowledge of the whole \"Winter Soldier\" subplot in the comics. Regardless, it was a fun ride, albeit predictable as far as the internal politics end goes. The themes in this one are far more \"mature\" for a comic book movie, too--it almost felt more like a political action thriller √† la Jack Ryan rather than a comic book based film, which made me love it even more. Phenomenal cast (the returns were fantastic as always, but the new characters also really did great work!), great music, the action sequences in this are SO awesome and generally I left this movie feeling very satisfied. I'm definitely going to see this more than once. It also makes me want to watch Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., which I haven't actually seen yet, but apparently there were plenty of references!\n\nOverall, this was a huge improvement on the first Captain America movie, which I actually didn't liked that much but it was a good movie. I'd venture to say I liked it more than The Avengers. D: Chris Evens gave us a wonderful performance as Captain America, it was the most Action comic book film I have ever seen! This film has a heart, it is Entertained, fast paced, filled with full of actions. Samuel L. Jackson did a wonderful job as Nick Fury, finally his character did something to do in this film, like fighting with assassins and so on. I loved him in this film much better than I did in Avengers : Age of Ultron (2015)in this film he has everything in it. Scarlet Johansson did a good job a supporting cast as Natasha Romanoff she wasn't annoying in here, she was a good supporter to cap. I hated her in Iron Man 2 and Avengers: Age of Ultron, but in this film I like her and I have enjoyed watching her in this film screen. This is the most wildest, most colorful team of superheroes ever brought to life on the big screen, is a massive success, a fan favorite and a critical darling. Winter Soldier, a tense, dramatic conspiracy thriller that somehow makes its strangest comic book elements work wonders, is a masterfully conceived and executed sequel that takes Captain America -- and, along with Guardians, the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe -- in a bold, exciting direction. Both are outstanding films. Both boast astonishing confidence, production design, action and visual effects. Both are terrific fun. Both represent a brave new world for comic book movies. And each one for completely different reasons. \n\nWhich is Marvel's crowning achievement? How do you even compare the two? Answer: you don't. Other than ranking the films by personal preference, it's a fool's errand to pit Cap, Black Widow and Falcon against Star Lord, Gamora, Drax, Rocket and Groot. You sit back, think to yourself it's good to be a geek, soak it all in, and wait for the inevitable Avengers crossover. Love 'em both. Watch both of 'em over and over and over again. Enjoy each one on its own terms. Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) was probably my second favorite Marvel film of 2014 but this one Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a kick ass best film ever! This film kick's Joss Whedon's Failure Avengers Age of Ultron in to the ground! This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth.\n\nAs Steve Rogers struggles to embrace his role in the modern world, he teams up with another super soldier, the Black Widow, to battle a new threat from history: an assassin known as the Winter Soldier. I love this movie and I don't care what anyone say! It Is my favorite best Marvel film of 2014!\n\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier is a 2014 American superhero film featuring the Marvel Comics character Captain America, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to 2011's Captain America: The First Avenger and the ninth installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).\n\n10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Marvel Studios Starring: Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Cobie Smulders, Frank Grillo, Emily VanCamp, Hayley Atwell, Robert Redford, Samuel L.

        "reviewText": "Oh man, was it good to get back to a great movie again after Thor: The Dark World. This movie, unlike that one, is well constructed, written, acted and directed. There is so much to love about the movie it's hard to name it all. The plot is well thought out and realized, complete with great twists and turns to keep you on your toes. I love the spy thriller astethic the movie presents, and it complements the more straight forward action very well. It also presents its themes of trust and morality in a solid and thoughtful way. The pacing is solid, the plot advances in a very natural way, and the movie sets up its important plot points ahead of time to make the movie more enjoyable on rewatches. The movie also does a great job with its characters. Steve, Natasha and Nick are all great characters with their own struggles, while also being very likeable, and they also have excellent chemistry. I love that Steve and Nat's relationsship isn't romantic, as that wouldn't work at all with these characters. I also really like Sam, he's sympathetic and a nice addition. The Winter Soldier is a great villain as well, which mostly comes from the fact that he is just a human, not some evil monster like so many other Marvel villains. I love watching his struggles with indentifying his past and resisting the changes made to his brain, as well as his relationsship with the hero. All this is of course helped by some solid performances from almost everyone involved. The direction is solid as well, with the perfect mix of wide shots and close-ups. The fight choreography is great, one can really feel the weight each fight carries. My only slight issue with the film is the fact that the heroes seem to be saved by plotholes a little too often, for example by a bad guy waiting to killing a good guy just long enough for something to appear to save them. It feels a little stupid, but it's not a big deal and it's pretty easy to ignore if you feel like it. Overall, this movie is extremely good. It does almost everything right, its flaws are small and inconsequental, and it's just a really entertaining movie. I recommend it to anyone who likes superhero movies, or just action movies in general.",

        "reviewText": "That is not to knock the first Captain America film because I enjoyed that too, just that Captain America: The Winter Soldier personally came off as superior. Some of the second half does try to cram in too much giving off an at times bloated and convoluted quality, other than that Captain America: The Winter Soldier was excellent. It is a great-looking film with stylish cinematography and editing that give off a gritty and audacious look, and the special effects and the stunts are of the quality that you can't take your eyes off them. The music is not quite as good as it was in the first but it has enough of the rousing excitement and haunting intensity to make it a good score that matches what is going on on screen. The action sequences are spectacularly choreographed and of edge-of-your-seat calibre whether it is a highway car chase or a sky battle with some of the destruction authentically harrowing, and the screenplay is one that is smart and snappy with heart aplenty. The story is mostly compelling and very cleverly constructed, it mixes action, comic-book adventure and political thriller and does it in a way that is well-balanced, that is alive with nimble nuances and in a way that the film gives off a sense that it knows what it's trying to be. It's suspenseful and exciting with its fair share of themes that gives the film emotion and depth. The characters are engaging and interesting, with their personalities deeper and more expansive, and there is a much more believable villain this time around(the big reveal was actually quite surprising). A great thing considering that the cast of cast is quite large if not quite to the everything-but-the-kitchen-sink extent; the interplay between the characters works a treat also. Anthony and Joe Russo direct astutely and the acting is fine, with Chris Evans even more confident than he was in the first, Scarlett Johansson at her fearless and Anthony Mackie fitting comfortably in his role. Samuel L. Jackson is as dependable as ever, Robert Redford in a bold move gives seasoned support and is not stiff at all and Sebastian Stan is similarly authoritative. All in all, while there are a couple of issues with the second half Captain America: The Winter Soldier is an excellent sequel and manages to outdo the enjoyable first film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

There's nazis, HYDRA, Nick Fury faking his freaking death, and action. Lots of fantastic Marvel action. This isn't just one of those films that are just 95% action, 5% storytelling, one of the things this films does best is balancing story with action. For example, the Winter Soldier and Steve have some of the best fights in the MCU, but whenever Steve finds out who the Winter Soldier is, it becomes not only an amazingly choreographed fight, but also an emotional one. In conclusion, this is the first truly great MCU sequel.",

        "reviewText": "Captain America: The Winter Solider, directed by the best two directors that MCU has on the team, in the Russo Brothers, crafted this well directed, brisk paced spy/action film, that has a lot to be praised for. The Russo Brothers took the MCU style, and completely flipped it into their own, which completely works, while becoming a model film for the MCU. They incorporated this darker and gritter tone, that essentially grounded the film well, while inevitably throwing in some well timed humor. Even though this new approach to the MCU was a breath of fresh air, the Russo Brothers set themselves up for some nitpicks, by transforming some things that were already set and stone, for the most part.\n\nThe Winter Soldier does everything that a sequel should do, and that's improve on every aspect from the last film. The creative team told a juicer, more cohesive story, with better character involvement and development, while the action not only took a step up, but became one of the standout films for it's action sequences. Not only did they improve from the first installment, keeping the continuity involved, but they created one of, if not, the best stand-alone films the MCU has put out to date. The creative team utilized so many great layers and depth, to really break everything down, while adding in a tremendous amount of tention throughout the entire narrative.\n\nWith Shield being the main focus of the film, I wasn't too sure on how things were going to play out, but because of the Russo Brothers creativity, I was perfectly okay with it! With Shield being center of attention, it allowed for Sam Jackson to have a lot more character moments, which had a heavy hand in the success of the film! Chris Evans is an absolute stud as Captain America and Steve Rogers! He is fleshed out much more, having the best character arch of the film. His character is a lot more complex this time around, other than being that public figure everyone knows him for. Evans steals every scene that he's in because of that genuine patriotism persona he carries, being nothing short of admirable. Scarlett Johansson was also another key contributor to the success of the film. We've seen her in a few films prior, getting a little bit more and more to do as the films go on, and she really sets out her skillset here. With decent chemistry and tention between her and Captain America, and her and Nick Fury, she shows once again, that she is capable of being an Avenger. Anthony Mackie gets his debut in the MCU as Sam Wilson/Falcon, and he is just an all around good addition. He doesn't add much as far as the superhero antics go, but he is a great compliment to Captain America, and the team. The Winter Soldier is a GAME villain! He doesn't have much to say, but his physical presence is quite enough for him to be a decent villain, with a great tie in to the series.\n\nThis is probably one of the strongest screenplays by Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus. They wasted no time after The First Avenger, to hop right into the screenplay for this film. McFeely and Markus added a great amount of wit to this script, by making everything cohesive to the story, while incorporating some dialed down, yet sharp humor. They added a great deal of politics to the narrative, that isn't just all in your face; it flows extremely well with the story, feeling authentic.\n\nThe action of the film was definitely the driving force of the film. All of the action scenes were shot so well, with many exciting and gritty action sequences! The Russo Brothers executed the hand-to-hand combat in such a professional way, and it just looked fantastic! The visual effects weren't heavily relied on, like they usually are, but when they were present, everything looked seamless.\n\nOverall, there is no reason why this film shouldn't be at the top of your list; one of the best the MCU has to offer !",

        "reviewText": "\"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\" gives super-hero sequels a good name. Not only is this $170 million blockbuster far better than its superb 'origins' predecessor, but it also is a real game-changer for the Marvel Universe. Former \"Fantastic Four\" actor Chris Evans reprises the title role as Steve Rogers, a 90-pound weakling turned 240-pound heavyweight, whose exploits inspired millions in World War II. Remember Rogers spent about 70 years in suspended animation in an iceberg after he contributed to the defeat the Nazis as well as Hydra. Rogers maintains his sense of honor, or naivety, throughout all his trials and tribulations. Evans makes his old-fashioned, nice-guy antics appear both convincing and charming. Meaning, Captain America remains essentially a goody-two-shoes-bachelor-with-a-shield. Our hero takes a licking but keeps on ticking despite whatever adversaries he tangles with in the second, in-name-only theatrical \"Captain America\" feature.\n\nCo-directors Anthony and Joe Russo of \"You, Me and Dupree\" let the action coast occasionally in this larger-than-life, two-hour-and-sixteen minute melodrama, but the combat scenes are staged with so much kinetic artistry that you will teeter on the edge of your seat during them. Everything is still appropriately formulaic but entirely outlandish in the gravity-defying Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely screenplay that puts our hero early and often behind the eight ball. My favorite close-quarters combat encounter occurs in the elevator with our hero cornered and outnumbered. Later scraps on the three Helicarriers emerge as no less electrifying. Predictably, everything is business as usual, but the Russo brothers and their scribes provide enough twists and turns to keep you interested in this noisy nonsense. Mind you, one or two things won't register as total surprises because you know some characters cannot perish. Nevertheless, if you enjoyed the first \"Captain America\" with Chris Evans, you will probably love the second one as much if not more! \n\nIn terms of a chronological timeline, \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\" takes place two years after the cataclysmic New York showdown, but the action itself covers only three days. Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) hasn't totally acclimated himself to the 21st century, but he refuses to let it interfere with his duty. While jogging around Washington, D.C., the fleet-footed Rogers befriends congenial Air Force flyboy Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie of \"Notorious\") who counsels veterans suffering from PTSD at the VA Hospital. No sooner have they gotten acquainted than Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson of \"The Avengers\") rolls up to whisk Rogers off onto his next dangerous mission. Later, Sam Wilson joins Rogers in his capacity as the winged hero Falcon. The first major action scene in \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\" is designed to show how extraordinary our eponymous hero is under fire but also how vulnerable he remains. Terrorists have stormed a S.H.I.E.L.D. surveillance ship, and they are issuing outrageous demands for the release of the hostages. Actually, this predicament reminded me of the first mission that Stallone and company embarked on in the initial \"Expendables\" epic. Mind you, Captain America and his trusty boomerang shield clear the perimeter so Black Widow and Brock Rumlow (Frank Grillo of \"End of Watch\") can free the hostages and settle with the terrorists. However, more than meets the eye occurs during this seemingly simple mission, and Captain America confronts his superior, S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nicholas Fury (Samuel L. Jackson of \"Pulp Fiction\"), about Black Widow's cyber-exploit. No sooner have Rogers and Fury fussed at each other at the sprawling new island headquarters of S.H.I.E.L.D. than Fury briefs Rogers about the next best thing. Project Insight will link three Helicarriers via spy satellites and to eradicate preemptively any threats either domestic or otherwise. Naturally, Captain America doesn't like Insight. If he is shocked that things have changed so much that such a measure must be taken, he is even more shocked later when Fury shows up at his apartment with blood on his hands and an assassin lurking nearby. Of course, D.C. Police are nowhere to be found when these imposters do everything except blast holes in either the engine block or the tires of his fortified SUV during a tense auto chase through D.C. streets. If this weren't enough for Captain America, he must go toe-to-toe with a mysterious combatant with a \"Six Million Dollar Man\" arm to save the day.\n\n\"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\" makes several references to the previous film that strengthens its bond with it. We get a glimpse of the girl that Steve loved and we watch as Steve's best friend, Bucky Barnes, contends with amnesia. The filmmakers not only bring us up to date about Bucky, but also we learn more about renegade enemy scientist Dr. Arnim Zola who collaborated with the Red Skull in the first \"Captain America.\" Furthermore, Zola opts to become a 'ghost-in-the machine' like Johnny Depp in \"Transcendence.\" The Russos and their writers keep hurling obstacles into Captain America's path, and our hero doesn't have an easy time conquering the villains. Anthony Mackie gets to play the first African-American Marvel super hero, and he attacks the role with relish. He wears a sophisticated set of mechanical wings that enable him to fly and perform far-fetched feats. Scarlett Johansson is just as tough and sexy as she was in \"The Avengers.\" Meanwhile, the best special effect in this special effects extravaganza isn't a special effect. Actor Robert Redford proves computer graphics stand no chance against the real thing. Redford qualifies as the most distinguished silver-screen good guy to cavort in such a dastardly manner since Henry Fonda in Sergio Leone's western \"Once Upon A Time in the West.\" If you've never seen Redford in action, you owe it to yourself to check him out. By his presence alone, Redford makes this action-adventure opus into a memorable experience. Let's hope that Marvel Studios can keep up with good work with the forthcoming \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" in 2015.",

It uses the strong continuity of the cinematic Marvel(as in, their own studio) universe better than any of the others, and does justice to many different elements, most of them set up prior to this. Events occur in this that will have serious consequences for future entries. The plot-driven nature and approach of a 70's political thriller(where some characters, all credible and with something to do, happen to wear a flag or the like) in a contemporary setting and with biting satire(on foreign policy, something not entirely new to these, but never before this sharp¬Ö commenting on mass surveillance and executions taking place before any trial against the (supposed) perpetrator) is spot-on. From a 40's war flick, with heroism and defined lines between good and evil, to the modern method of taking on the opposition ‚Äì with spying, and questionable tactics(compared to one army versus another).\n\nThe action all comes about naturally, it's personal, hard-hitting and, on account of next to no CGI, it's \"real\". Each intense set-piece is varied(fighting, shooting, chasing both on foot and vehicular¬Ö), you will remember them, and except for one bit, they feel fresh and original. Among the very few weaknesses are that Sharon(VanCamp, another compelling and strong woman) has nothing to do in this, appearing as if her important scenes were cut, and/or that she was setup for the next one. She is the only one that that goes for, a pleasant surprise considering the seemingly bloated cast of characters. This explores S.H.I.E.L.D., and how the iconic super soldier fits into it ¬Öor, whether or not he does, at all. The 3D is unobtrusive, adding depth and atmosphere, similar to Avatar.\n\nThere is violence and disturbing content in this. I recommend this to any fan of, well, blockbusters. 10/10",

        "reviewText": "It is not easy to make sequels---or new episodes that build on past exposition---and live up to the original. But this is one film that manages to remain fresh, thanks to an imaginative script.\n\n\"The Winter Soldier\" is a fast-moving story that comes out of the gate with urgency and keeps the interest of the viewer. In its final chapter, it slows a little, but still remains interesting by providing plenty of information that will affect later episodes.\n\nBut back to the beginning of this film: Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) and company transport to a ship seized by pirates in the Indian Ocean. In the first moments of this section, I felt like I had been here before; it felt so much like playing a \"Splinter Cell\" mission, which is no criticism. As the scene continued, many questions were raised about alliances and loyalty.\n\nThen back to S. H. I. E. L. D. HQ, where Project Insight is unveiled. Captain American voices doubts about the program. Since he has been absent from the world, one might wonder if he is just being old-fashioned or if he is principled.\n\nA trip to the Smithsonian cleverly adds backstory and keeps things fresh.\n\nOne senses that Rogers is struggling to keep up; after all, S. H. I. E. L. D. is new to him. Is there a clear path to justice in this modern war of shady combatants? Later we find that nothing was ever clear.\n\nAt one point or another everyone's loyalty is called into question, even Nick Fury's (Samuel L. Jackson).\n\nEvery hero story needs a worthy villain. The Winter Soldier is introduced, a formidable foe.\n\nThe film contains some exciting chase scenes and even a scene of escape from an elevator, all done brilliantly. The fighting scenes are lively and engaging, including those by Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson).\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this is more than an action film. There are philosophical questions at play, as when a quote echoes Benjamin Franklin's quote about those who might sacrifice freedom for security. Since this film was made, those concerns have become even more pertinent.\n\nOf course Hydra is involved in this story. But how much? As with \"Marvel's Agents of S. H. I. E. L. D.\" it can be difficult to know exactly who is an enemy.\n\nThe cameo by Stan Lee in this film feels like actual casting, not just stunt casting.\n\nWatch for the beautiful graphics that accompany the main end credits. And the final two scenes that hint of future game changers.\n\nFinally, one of the best things about this film are the grand visuals that grab your attention. All in all, this part of the MCU is worthy of being watched.",

Catching up with all the MCU films that I've missed on Disney+,I got set to finally encounter the soldier.\n\nView on the film:\n\nDrawing their first issue of the MCU, co-directors Joe and Anthony Russo team up with cinematographer Trent Opaloch to make a splash by welding the flawless CGI with white-knuckle hand-to-hand combat sequence, placed in narrow locations such as lifts to give a up-close perspective to the ground and pound attacks.\n\nThrowing Captain America's shield across the screen, the Russo's cross the pristine shine of the CBM with the glossy anxiety atmosphere of a Thriller, thanks to ultra-stylised arc shots bleeding The Winter Soldier across the panels of the screen,which sets off rapid whip-pans towards Captain America having to outwit his own side.\n\nMentioned by the two main leads afterwards that they were allowed to improvise some of their dialogue, the screenplay by MCU regulars Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely frees up the film from the back issue weight which had caused Iron Man 2 (2010-also reviewed) to be a challenging production, to instead thrillingly focus on Steve Rogers finding his wholesome ideals of the Govt, to become increasingly tainted.\n\nDeparting from the fantastical baddies of the past MCU titles for something more grounded in Project MKUltra and NSA programs, the writers thrillingly place Rogers and Black Widow (a wonderful Scarlett Johansson, who combines Widow's deadly action moves with a playful quick- witted edge) in a system seeping with paranoid corruption,where the reverberation of the Hydra terrorist organisation of the 1940's remain in motion.\n\nAfter bringing him in on the great Captain America: The First Avenger (2011-also reviewed) Chris Evans gives a terrific turn as Rogers,thanks to planting a seed of doubt in Rogers life-long belief of who is good and evil,as Captain America comes in from the cold to take on The Winter Soldier.",

        "reviewText": "With Rogers, Fury, and Romanoff previously established, directors Joe and Anthony Russo do a magnificent job at expanding these characters ‚Äì along with some secondary characters we've seen before ‚Äì providing more depth to understanding their actions and how they will affect future stories. Sam Jackson has a stronger presence this time around, validating Nick Fury as a main staple in the MCU among the big boys. Captain America is stronger, faster, and a more refined soldier, equipped with better fighting skills and understanding of current technology. Evans plays the earnestness of Captain America's black and white morality with convincing finesse in an age of grey that he has yet to find a comfortable middle. And Johansson progresses the allure of the cunning and multifaceted Black Widow, while bringing a splendid and lively balance to Rogers' straight and narrow.\n\nAmidst such a tight and clever script, The Winter Soldier introduces a band of new characters, all of whom play a significant role, creating a more layered and conceivably real MCU. Frank Grillo brings the swolling mass of muscle known as S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Brock Rumlow to life. Emily VanCamp surprises with her portrayal of Agent 13, whom I wish had more screen time with Cap than just two quick scenes. Robert Redford plays Alexander Pierce, a superior ranking Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., friend to Nick Fury, and representative of the World Security Council. Pierce is a wonderful look into the higher ranks at S.H.I.E.L.D., contributing new insights as to how the organization is run outside of Fury, Agent Coulson, and Agent Maria Hill. Anthony Mackie is Sam Wilson aka The Falcon, an ex-military special-ops paratrooper and a welcomed addition recruited by Rogers to help fight the good fight. Mackie fits comfortably among the cast of veteran actors and should play nicely with the other Avengers.\n\nEnhanced for combat and strength, The Winter Soldier's presence is terrifying when it comes to any action scene. Sebastian Stan does an amazing job holding his own against his targets and those who get in his way of his missions. My only gripe is that it is not explained how he obtains the immense power and skills he beholds. The connection between Rogers and The Winter Soldier is dealt with true care and excels the story of Captain America from the first film brilliantly. (Be sure to stay after the credits for a nice button leading into Captain America 3.) \n\nThe Winter Soldier is not just a fantastic sequel to Captain America: The First Avenger and The Avengers, it should also be recognized as one of the best sequels ever made. In fact, writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the duo behind Thor: The Dark World, the Narnia Trilogy, and The First Avenger, have done such a great job shaping Captain America's story that this movie could almost stand on its own. There are many exciting twists and turns in this well-constructed, political action-thriller, but nothing comes as more of a shock than how important the story is at defining the direction of the MCU. What takes place in The Winter Soldier, along with an awesome mid-credits sequence tie-in, will inherently influence Avengers: Age of Ultron as well as Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. ‚Äì which should make the TV series a lot more interesting and reward fans who have stuck by its side.\n\nTonally, The Winter Soldier is the darkest story we've come to encounter, raising many deep-seated questions about government and soldiers of war while also taking Rogers on an emotional journey. It also has the best action choreography among all of the MCU movies thus far. Whedon's NYC battle in The Avengers is beautifully shot and written, but cannot compare to the hard-hitting set pieces found in The Winter Soldier, each building up to the bigger whole. The Russo brothers come from a background of directing television comedies such as Arrested Development and Community, and it's extraordinary how well they handle a big budget action blockbuster from cinematography to pacing. They do infuse their own style of comedy with fun references and a cameo other than Stan Lee, functioning properly within the confines of the tone and story. Henry Jackman (Captain Phillips; Wreck-It Ralph; X-Men: First Class) also composes an adrenaline pumping score that sets the right mood every time.\n\nThe biggest fault found in The Winter Soldier is that it does not address the whereabouts of other heroes or where we are in terms of the time line of the other movies. Why can't Captain America call on Tony Stark to help him out or even Hawkeye who is a member of S.H.I.E.L.D. himself. This is a recurring problem we have seen throughout Phase 2 of the MCU in Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World. Marvel Studios needs to acknowledge this hiccup if they want us to continue to believe all of these characters live in the same universe together. You cannot exclude these characters once you have opened Pandora's Box.\n\nMarvel Studios has hit this one out of the ball park with yet another gripping adaptation for fans to enjoy for years to come. By and large, Captain America: The Winter Soldier succeeds on all fronts. It is the perfect set up for future films and at the same time it increases the value of its predecessors. There is little to argue against its merits and should be regarded as one of the greatest superhero movies of all time.",

        "reviewText": "Captain America: The Winter Soldier is the third film in Phase 2 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (after last year's Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World). Compared with the mighty giant green monster, the hammer wielding Norse thunder god or the 'genius, philanthropist, billionaire, playboy' armor man, the Captain was never quite as appealing as the rest of the 'Unusuals'. Steve Rogers is portrayed as an old-fashioned, straightforward, honest, courageous, sincere, patriotic superhero. This makes him a less-interesting, boring character. Moreover, as Tony Stark said it, \"Everything special about you came out of a bottle!\"\n\nMost film-goers would know that Marvel films are famous for its bright, fun and not-so-serious approach to its storytelling, together with some catchy, witty dialogues. This film is a game changer in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This time around, Marvel decided to take a different approach on things: To make a Captain America sequel with a more serious, darker plot development and more face-to-face close-range hand combat fights. What should have been a typical superhero film, now becomes a conspiracy-espionage thriller.\n\nTwo years after the events that happened in New York city, the Captain still struggles with adjusting himself to the modern world, with no apparent social life or girl friend, which is why Natasha/Black Widow tries to introduce or recommend him some cute girls in S.H.I.E.L.D. for him to date with. He is shocked when he learns that the very governmental organisation he is working for is not what it seems to be, as the Cap said in the trailer, \"This isn't freedom. This is fear\". Soon, he finds himself entangled in a conspiracy that puts millions of innocent lives at risk.\n\nThe film comes with excellent, fast-paced action choreography. Although the cinematography is a bit dodgy due to the shaky-cam techniques used for depicting the chaotic moments, the fight scenes between the Winter Soldier and the Captain is fantastic and serves as one of the film's highlights. The audience finally gets to see how the Captain's shield is utilised effectively in both offensive and defensive combat situations. It also good to see again how Natasha kicks ass in the film.\n\nAll actors delivered a pretty decent performance in the film. Once again, Chris Evans and Scarlett Johannson both proved that they fit their roles well, adding more depth to the characters they portray in the film. Sam Wilson/Falcon is a welcome addition to the Marvel franchise and hopefully he will appear again in the Avengers sequel. Unfortunately, despite the film's title, the winter soldier is not a complex villain and doesn't appear much in the film. It's such a shame to just show him as a formidable physical fighter who's capable of challenging the Captain.\n\nThe film is well-scripted, filled with suspense while highlighting some important socio-political issues such as government surveillance and control in its storytelling. Although the twists in the film is predictable and fairly easy to guess, the sequel is a marked improvement compared to its predecessor, Captain America: The First Avenger. The story unfolds gradually and comes with huge, surprising developments by the end of the film. Marvel Cinematic Universe is not going to be the same again. What's going to happen next? How the story is going to progress in Avengers: Age of Ultron, after what had happened in this film? Interesting.\n\nRating: 8.5/10\n\nhttp://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/03/movie-review-captain-america- winter.html\n\nBe warned. This is not the typical fun, 'not-so-serious', entertaining Marvel film that you used to watch in the past. You might like it or find it a bore. In order to recognize some of the characters in the film, you need to remember some of Marvel's Phase One films. Most importantly, you need to watch Captain America: The First Avenger before watching this to understand the plot.\n\nNote: Guess you don't need me to remind you to stay for the mid-credit and post-credit scenes. It foreshadows what's going to happen next by introducing a lesser-known supervillain and two new characters, 'Miracles' (another name for 'mutants' because of screen rights issues) which going to be in the Avengers sequel, Age of Ultron. It further confirms that one of weapons depicted in The Avengers is indeed one of the six infinity stones.",

The plot development is great start to finish, consistently providing intrigue for various plot points. Character development and diving into the emotional caches of each character work well, and come to be a highlight of the film.

In addition, all kinds of spy assassination dramas were almost spy movies. For a time, it was not even a superhero movie, but a spy movie with upgraded equipment. In the second half, the visual effect of a large movie was produced to climax before the original was restored.",

        "reviewText": "Went into the movie not expecting much as I felt that the first Captain America was one of the weaker movies in Phase one of the Avengers. However, this movie was one of the best of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nFirst off, the action and fight scenes in the movie are just awesome and there is plenty of action to keep you entertained throughout the entire movie. There is also enough humour to balance all this. The characters all had their own amazing moments and the acting is decent as well. You get to see more of Nick Fury, and he was awesome in this. Black Widow is used much more in this movie and as well as being badass, she brings out more of the Captain's story. Sam Wilson (the Falcon) is great and is involved in some great action scenes. The villains in this movie were awesome as well.\n\nQuite enjoyed the story as well. There were a few twists; some unexpected, some expected. And the reveal of the unexpected twists in the final third were epic. The story is not just about Captain America and the Winter Soldier, there are darker forces at play and causes the Captain to ask dangerous questions.\n\nThis movie is very entertaining, the story is decent, the ending is awesome and satisfying and I would recommend watching this. Makes for a decent political thriller as well. This will easily be one of my favourite movies.",

        "reviewText": "The start of the Russo Era. This movie is highly ranked among MCU fans(mostly No.1), yes I do agree it is the best made MCU film, its just isn't my favourite.\n\nThe action is spectacular, the hand to hand combat between Steve and Bucky was top notch choreography. They kept wide shots and less cuts, and in day light, we can clearly see all their moves. Action wise, this is the best in MCU but personally I don't weight action as much as I wait other factors.\n\nThe story is also great, nazi-hyder still lying around in Shield was a great twist. Hyder never leaves Captain America. The Bucky twist also feels natural, brings a relationship element with the main villain. The flashbacks and past film does the job to set it up.\n\nRusso's got Natasha so right, she shined throughout the film, her action sequence were the most bad-ass female fight I have ever seen (right below Kill-Bill). She actually felt like a former deadly assassin of KGB, Scarlet Johansson played her well.\n\nSamuel L Jackson completely solds Nick Fury, his car sequence was great. His with his classic wits are spinkled all over the film. But his return from death was a let down. I hate when characters come back from death. His lines 'Last Time I trusted someone, I lost an eye' , ' You need to keep both eyes open' were fantastic but sadly Captain Marvel happened.\n\nAddition of Sam Wilson was great, he brings the more organic feel to the film. His running gag of 'On your left' got better with Endgame. He isn't a perfect soldier but a good man, deserves the Captain America Mantle.\n\nChris Evans sells as the patriot Steve Rogers, his characters arc progresses and we see him getting more further away from patriotism, doubting the government and agency (Shield/Hyder). ' This isn't freedom', and his speech at the end in Shield Headquarters was inspiring.\n\nI will never forget the lift scene, the comedy is more subtle and feels more mature. The movie could be called a political thriller. But this also has a very clich√© ( most clich√©st thing in my book), saving brainwashed friend by reminding him of past greatness. The final action sequence was good but getting chips into ships to disarm them, felt cheap in relation to other great bits. Hyder killing all people just like any other villain would, isn't something new, the movie spent good quality time to connect the villain's tyreny to heros' in humane level but failed to connect why Hyder will go this big now. The movie's third act could have stayed more grounded just like the rest to the film.\n\nI highly respect the script and direction of the film, I just haven't seen it 50 times to love this film as much as I love the other once.",

      "text": "Two years after the events of The Avengers (2012), Steve Rogers, a.k.a. Captain America (Chris Evans) has settled down in Washington DC, doing field work for S.H.I.E.L.D., while adjusting to modern life after seventy years in the ice.\n\nAs the movie opens, Steve makes the acquaintance of Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), a retired pararescueman, as Sam does a morning jog around the Tidal Basin. Steve completes multiple laps over Sam until the latter gets tired and sits to rest. While recuperating, Sam recommends that Steve listen to Marvin Gaye's \"Trouble Man\" soundtrack to get up to speed on the last few decades. Steve adds it to his list, along with things like Star Wars, Star Trek, and the Rocky movies. Steve gets a text telling him to stand by the curb in front of the Capitol. A car pulls up, driven by Natasha Romanoff, a.k.a. Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). She greets the two men and Steve hops in the car.\n\nThe duo joins other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents led by Brock Rumlow (Frank Grillo) as they fly over the Indian Ocean. A S.H.I.E.L.D. vessel, the Lemurian Star, has been taken over by pirates led by Georges Batroc (Georges St-Pierre). They are holding hostages, including Agent Jasper Sitwell (Maximiliano Hern√°ndez). Steve, in his Captain America outfit, dives out of the jet armed only with his shield and no parachute. He lands in the water and climbs onto the ship, beating every goon that comes in his way. Natasha and the other agents drop down to aid Cap. The agents defeat the pirates and rescue the hostages while Batroc tries to run and is caught by Cap. They fight on the deck of the ship, with Batroc getting quickly back up on his feet even when Cap manages to take him down. \"I thought you were more than a mask,\" he says smugly. Steve removes his mask and replies, \"Let's find out.\" He continues the fight and knocks Batroc down for good with his shield.\n\nSteve finds Natasha extracting files from the ship's computer using a S.H.I.E.L.D. flash drive. When Steve calls her out, she tells him she'd been given a different mission by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). She pulls the flash drive out, moments before a pirate runs past and throws a grenade at the two. Steve grabs Natasha and jumps through a window before it explodes.\n\nSteve is not happy with the fact that he was kept in the dark about Natasha's task. Upon returning to the Triskelion, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s headquarters on Theodore Roosevelt Island in the middle of the Potomac River, Steve goes to Fury's office to confront him. He's not mollified by Fury's excuse--that Steve wouldn't be comfortable if he WAS in the loop. Fury reminds Steve that he can't trust anybody, even those who work closely with him. He takes Steve into an elevator down to the cavernous underground level where there are three Helicarriers being worked on as part of Project Insight, an operation that connects the Helicarriers to spy satellites used to prevent any possible terrorist attacks, and allow them to preemptively eliminate threats to national security. In part a response to the Chitauri invasion, Steve sees this as more of an aggressive form of protection that makes the sorts of compromises the Strategic Scientific Reserve made to win World War II look mild by comparison. Fury insists that he get with the program.\n\nSteve visits the National Air and Space Museum, to check out an exhibit dedicated to his exploits during World War II. A child recognizes him in disguise, but Steve holds a finger to his lips asking the kid not to point him out. The kid understands and keeps quiet. Among the displays are mannequins with his World War II uniform and the costumes of Steve's fellow Howling Commandos, and a small exhibit dedicated to Steve's childhood friend Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), the only Howling Commando to have been killed in action. Steve checks out a video of his old love, Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), in which she commemorates Steve on his actions as Cap. He later visits an elderly Peggy, who has since been married and had children. She is ill and although she initially appears to recognize Steve, she slips back into a state where she believes she's seeing him again for the first time since he was lost, shocked to see him alive. He merely says, \"I couldn't leave my best girl. Not when she owes me a dance.\"\n\nFury tries to access the files that Natasha got on the flash drive, but he is unable to get past security, something that was apparently set by himself. He goes to meet with Secretary of Defense Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford) as he is meeting with the World Security Council over the matter of the hijacking of the Lemurian Star. Fury tells Pierce that they need to delay Project Insight. Pierce says 'okay', but he wants Fury to have Iron Man stop by his niece's birthday.\n\nSteve visits the VA, where Sam is providing trauma counseling to other veterans suffering from PTSD. After the group meeting, Sam reveals to Steve that he lost his friend Riley in battle in Iraq after he was shot down in the air with an RPG. Despite the lost of his friend, Sam still loves flying. He asks Steve what makes him happy. He doesn't know.\n\nAs Fury drives, he contacts Agent Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) to rendezvous with him for something to do with Project Insight. As he hangs up and stops at an intersection, a police car pulls up alongside Fury's car on his passenger's side. Fury notices that the officers driving the car are wearing sunglasses and looking at him very suspiciously -- perhaps because he's a black man driving a very expensive SUV. The driver hits his siren for a quick second and pulls forward.\n\nJust as Fury pulls into the intersection, another police car appears and T-bones Fury's car on the driver's side, sending it into some bollards. The first police car suddenly stops and backs straight into Fury's car. A third police car simultaneously plows into Fury's car from behind, and several more units quickly arrive, boxing Fury's car in. Then a black windowless van pulls up, discharging a full SWAT team. The patrol and SWAT officers draw submachine guns and assault rifles and take up positions around Fury's car. The onboard computer informs Fury that there are no police units in the area, meaning that these cops are actually hired assassins.\n\nSeconds later, the assassins open fire, riddling the car with bullets. It does them no good, as the car is armored and the windows are made of bulletproof glass. With that failure, they move to their next strategy: they grab a hydraulic battering ram from their van and try to use it to break the glass on the driver's side window. As soon as the computer reports to Fury that the window's integrity level has reached 1%, Fury grabs a hidden minigun and opens fire, killing most of the assassins and destroying a few of their cars. After a prolonged exchange of gunfire, he commands the car to drive itself out. Fury's car takes off on autopilot with two police cars in hot pursuit.\n\nA lengthy pursuit unfolds through the streets. After forcing their way through stopped traffic, and another running shootout, two of the assassins' vehicles catch up to Fury and begin to trade paint with him. Fortunately for Fury, his onboard computer detects a box truck about to catch up to them at the next intersection. Fury slams on his brakes, while the assassins' cars continue on and are broadsided by the truck.\n\nFury commands the vehicle's computer to get him to a safe location and speeds off. Before the computer can find a safe spot for him, he sees a figure dressed in black standing in the middle of the road. The mysterious mercenary shoots a magnetic bomb that attaches itself to the underside of Fury's car. It explodes and flips the car over. The would-be assassin walks over to the vehicle, ready to finish Fury off, but he escapes in time by burning a hole through the roof of the car and the street below with a laser weapon.\n\nSteve goes back to his apartment to find his pretty neighbor, Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp), going to do laundry. He offers to let her use his machine, but she says she just spent a lot of time in the disease ward at the hospital and doesn't want to pass any sickness to Steve. She tells him that he left his stereo on.\n\nSteve hears music as he cautiously enters his house, grabbing his shield for protection. He finds an injured Fury sitting on his couch. Out loud, Fury says his wife kicked him out, but he shows Steve through text messages on his phone that anybody could be listening. Before he can say anything else, Fury is shot three times. Steve looks out the window for the shooter. Fury hands him the flash drive and tells him not to trust anybody. Sharon comes in, armed with a gun, and tends to Fury. Steve runs after the sniper. Steve smashes through the walls to catch up with the assassin outside. He throws his shield at him, but the sniper catches it with one swift move in his left hand, then throws it back to Steve. Steve catches the shield and is shoved back a bit and looks up, only to find the assassin has disappeared.\n\nNatasha meets up with Steve at the hospital, where they watch doctors operating on Fury. Maria joins them. The doctors try to revive him, but Fury flatlines, and presumably dies. Afterwards, Natasha asks Steve why Fury was in his apartment. He claims to not know, right as Rumlow tells him they need him back at S.H.I.E.L.D. Natasha calls Steve a bad liar, and they separate. We see that Steve hid Fury's flash drive behind a pack of gum in the vending machine.\n\nSteve is brought in to speak with Pierce. He also asks Steve why Fury was in his apartment, hoping to find clues to who killed him. They suspect Batroc after he was found the previous night in a safe house. Pierce insinuates that Fury hired the pirates to infiltrate the ship so that he could acquire classified information, and was then killed after the deal went wrong. Steve denies the claim. Pierce asks him again why Fury was there. Steve only says that Fury told him not to trust anybody.\n\nSteve hops on the elevator, accompanied by Rumlow and a few members of the STRIKE team. As the elevator starts down, Steve senses that he's walked into a trap, as Rumlow and his men have their hands on their guns. At the first stop, a couple of men in suits get on, and Steve notices that one of them is sweating profusely. Then at the next stop, a couple of burly guys get on and take up positions in front of him, blocking him in. At this point, Steve decides to let them know he knows what they're trying to do, prompting the men to attack him. They strap magnetic cuffs to his wrists and hold an electric stunning rod to him, but Steve overpowers them and knocks everyone out cold, Rumlow being the last to fall.\n\nSitwell sees the fight through a surveillance camera in the elevator and orders the STRIKE team to get to the elevator. Steve breaks off the cuffs with his shield and sees the STRIKE team heading his way. He breaks off the elevator wires to send the elevator down to a lower flower. The team still approaches, so Steve breaks through the glass in the elevator, falling dozens of floors and hits the plaza, landing on his shield. He runs to the garage and rides out on his motorcycle, evading the obstacles laid out by S.H.I.E.L.D. A Quinjet emerges to shoot at Steve. He throws his shield into its engines, grounding it and giving him an opportunity to hop over it and escape.\n\nSitwell orders S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to be on the lookout for Steve. Sharon demands to know why they're issuing a manhunt for Captain America. Pierce comes into the room and brands him a fugitive for withholding information on Fury's death.\n\nSteve goes back to the hospital to retrieve the flash drive from the vending machine, but it's gone. Natasha appears, chewing some gum, making clear she's found it first. Steve pushes her into a room and demands to know what she knows about the mysterious assassin. She and intelligence agencies only know the assassin as the Winter Soldier. He nearly killed her on a mission in Iran, during which the target she was assigned to protect was killed, and he has reportedly been responsible for over 200 assassinations over the past 50 years. They decide to use the flash drive to find out what they can on the Winter Soldier's whereabouts.\n\nPierce meets with the WSC members again, defending Fury as a martyr, though they believe he was killed for trying to cover up his own illegal dealings. They all opt to reactivate Project Insight.\n\nSteve and Natasha go to a mall, disguised as a civilian couple. They take the flash drive to an Apple Store and pop it into a MacBook Pro to find the signal coming from Wheaton, New Jersey. Natasha tells Steve that they have nine minutes or less before S.H.I.E.L.D. agents find them. On the way out, the duo spots Rumlow and his men searching the place. Natasha pulls Steve in for a kiss on the escalator to draw attention away from themselves, since public displays of affection make people uncomfortable (and make faces harder to see). The ruse works and Rumlow doesn't spot them.\n\nSteve and Natasha drive where the signal pointed, ending up at...Camp Lehigh, Steve's old training base. As they arrive at the gates, Steve briefly envisions his former, smaller self running past him.\n\nHe and Natasha enter the facility, which is discovered to be an original S.H.I.E.L.D. office. They find framed portraits of Howard Stark and Peggy, along with Col. Chester Phillips. Steve looks behind a bookshelf and uncovers a room full of computers. The only modern type of technology in the room is a small port for the flash drive. Natasha inserts it and activates a computer. A German voice speaks and analyzes the two. The voice belongs to Dr. Arnim Zola (Toby Jones), the HYDRA scientist responsible for building Red Skull's various weapons. He transferred his consciousness into a computer in 1972 after he was diagnosed with a terminal illness. Zola explains to the duo that HYDRA was formed on the belief that humanity could not be trusted with its own freedom, and after the war, as part of Operation Paperclip, the United States government recruited Zola and other HYDRA operatives, where they conspired against their new employers. Since then, S.H.I.E.L.D. has been nothing more than a front allowing HYDRA to continue their work, influencing history from the shadows, including various politicians and even Howard and Maria Stark. As one last bombshell, Zola reveals that this whole exposition speech of his was to stall Steve and Natasha so they'll be hit by a missile HYDRA has sent to take them out in less than 30 seconds. Steve and Natasha jump into a hole as the missile hits, destroying the computers. Steve protects himself and Natasha as the place crumbles. Rumlow and his men arrive and search the place, but the two have escaped.\n\nIn his home, Pierce bids goodbye to his housekeeper, Renata (Branka Katic), just as the Winter Soldier appears in his kitchen. He never speaks a word. Pierce starts to talk to him when Renata comes back to get her phone. Remarking that he wishes she'd knocked, Pierce shoots her twice because she's seen him and the Winter Soldier talking.\n\nSteve and Natasha hide out at Sam's home, knowing they can trust him. Natasha expresses remorse over her involvement with HYDRA agents. Sam decides to help them, but first, they need to get him equipment: a flight suit known as the EXO-7 Falcon. When he asks Steve and Natasha if they can retrieve the suit for him, they scoff, saying it'll be easy.\n\nBack in D.C., Sitwell walks away from a meeting with Senator Stern (Garry Shandling). Before they part ways, Stern leans in and whispers to Sitwell, \"Hail HYDRA.\" At that point, he gets a phone call. It's Sam, standing in Sitwell's line of sight, who instructs him to get in a car around the corner to meet with him and his friends.\n\nSteve and Natasha take Sitwell up to the roof of a tall building. Steve holds Sitwell over the edge, threatening to drop him. Sitwell knows this isn't Steve's style. Steve agrees... and lets Natasha kick Sitwell off the roof. Sam catches Sitwell, and drops him back on the roof. Now fearing for his life, Sitwell confesses that Zola created the algorithms used by Project Insight to locate certain people around the world based on personal facts or data. The targets are picked based on their past actions, allowing HYDRA to easily track down and kill anyone who could pose a threat to them before they're in a position to fight back. Realizing that Pierce will likely have him killed for spilling secrets, Sitwell agrees to cooperate and go with them.\n\nAs Steve, Sam and Natasha are escorting Sitwell to a secure location, they are ambushed by the Winter Soldier. HYDRA's assassin jumps onto the heroes' car, yanks Sitwell out through the window, and throws him into the path of a truck. The assassin is joined by several members of the STRIKE team, who promptly ram their car into the inside guardrail. A shootout ensues as the Winter Soldier trades fire with Natasha, while Steve and Sam engage the HYDRA agents.\n\nAt one point, the Winter Soldier thinks he's found Natasha hiding behind a car, and he shoots a rocket at that spot to draw her out, but it's actually just a recording played back on a phone. Natasha jumps on the Winter Soldier's back and attempts to garrote him from behind, but he overpowers her. She attempts to run, only for the Winter Soldier to get his gun back and shoot her in the left shoulder from behind. As he climbs onto a car and prepares to finish her off, Steve attacks him. After a drawn out fight, Steve is able to overpower the Winter Soldier with a judo throw that knocks off his faceplate. As the Winter Soldier gets to his feet, Steve is horrified to realize just who he is: Bucky Barnes, alive and well, and with no memory of who Steve is.\n\nSteve's brief hesitation is long enough for Bucky to pull a gun on him, only to be taken down by a timed attack from Sam. Bucky regains his footing, and tries to shoot Steve again, but is forced to dodge as Natasha uses his grenade launcher to fire a grenade at him that takes out a nearby car. As the smoke clears, Bucky escapes while Rumlow and his remaining men capture Steve, Sam, and Natasha.\n\nRumlow and his men load Steve and his allies into a van, intending to take them to a remote location to execute them and bury them in unmarked graves. As they come to a stop in a tunnel, Sam notices Natasha is bleeding seriously from her shoulder and tells the guards she needs assistance. One of the guards agrees, and promptly pulls out an electric rod to knock out the other guard, before taking off her helmet, revealing herself to be Maria Hill. She helps them escape from the van by drilling a hole through the floor. The STRIKE team don't realize their prisoners are gone until they come to a stop in a storm drain and open the back doors to remove them.\n\nMaria takes the heroes to a secret facility to treat Natasha. Fury is also there, recuperating from his injuries. He survived the attempt on his life thanks to an anti-stress serum developed by Banner, originally to control his Hulk problem, but which can also allow a person to fake one's own death. When he and Natasha are a little more rested, they gather with the other heroes to formulate an attack strategy. They don't have much time. Project Insight is set to launch within hours, at which point the three Helicarriers will form a triangle and lock sights on their targets around the globe. The people who will be targeted run the gamut between very minor and very serious threats to HYDRA. Fury takes out three chips that they will use to override the Helicarriers' systems. He turns control over to Steve to give orders.\n\nWithin a bank, the HYDRA agents work to fix Bucky's arm, which took damage during the fight with Steve. He has brief flashbacks to his old life, from his fall off the train to when Zola and his henchmen from HYDRA found him. His left arm was amputated and replaced with the bionic metal arm. When he began to freak out, Zola had him sedated and later put on ice, only ever thawed out when HYDRA needed him to assassinate someone. Pierce comes in, praising Bucky's work and asking him to come back to do it again. Bucky asks about Steve, claiming to know him. Realizing that Bucky might be getting his memories back, Pierce orders the agents to get him back to his original killing mindset.\n\nSteve stands on a bridge, reminiscing about his time spent with Bucky. A flashback shows Bucky with Steve after the funeral of Steve's mother. Bucky offers to let Steve stay with his family, the only condition being that he has to shine Bucky's shoes. Sam comes over, prepared to join Steve in the fight. Steve tells him to suit up before going to the Captain America exhibit to get his old World War II uniform. The elderly security guard (Stan Lee) sees the suit missing and comments that he's gonna get fired.\n\nThe World Security Council members arrive at the Triskelion, guided by Pierce. He gives them electronic pins that will give them access to anywhere in the building. Steve and Sam break into the building. Steve accesses a mic that patches him through to every loudspeaker. He tells the agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. that Pierce is a traitor who is working with HYDRA, and that they must stop Project Insight from happening. Rumlow and his goons break into the control room. He forces an agent to release the Helicarriers, but Sharon intervenes. She forces Rumlow to drop his gun. He does, then grabs his knife and cuts Sharon's arm. A gunfight breaks out in which most of the SHIELD technicians are killed. Rumlow, amidst the bullets, manages to release the Helicarriers himself.\n\nSteve and Sam make their way to the Helicarriers as the HYDRA agents shoot at them. Steve gets the first chip into one Helicarrier, while Sam flies around, providing cover. He manages to get a heat-seeking missile that was aimed at him to hit a Helicarrier to give him an entrance, allowing him to place the second chip there. Hill, meanwhile, monitors their progress while simultaneously killing any HYDRA agents who attempt to stop her.\n\nPierce tries to convince the World Security Council members to join him in support of Project Insight, making it sound like a peaceful effort to subdue potential attacks around the world. He hands Councilman Singh (Bernard White) a glass of champagne, but Singh refuses to join him and tosses the glass. Pierce pulls out a gun and aims at Singh, but Councilwoman Hawley (Jenny Agutter) kicks Singh away, then takes down the other HYDRA goons in the room before taking the gun. It turns out Natasha took Hawley's place, using special technology that allows her to perfectly mimic a person's face. Her backup comes when Fury steps out of a helicopter, to Pierce's surprise. Knowing Pierce probably changed the retinal scan, Fury removes his eyepatch to reveal his scarred left eye also has a retinal scan, which enables him to override Project Insight along with Pierce, as they are the only two agents of the highest degree needed for that. Pierce sets off the pins he gave the council members, which burn deeply into each member's sternum. He threatens to set off Natasha's, forcing her to walk out with him. Natasha activates it herself, burning herself, but not as badly as the others. This gives Fury the opening to shoot Pierce twice, killing him. His last words are \"Hail HYDRA.\"\n\nThe HYDRA agents begin to lock on their targets, with over 700,000 and counting. As this happens, Bucky is set loose, killing off the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents trying to aid Steve and Sam in taking down the last Helicarrier. He rips off Sam's wings and throws him off the Helicarrier. Sam manages to deploy his chute to break his fall. Upon landing, he runs back into the Triskelion to fight Rumlow.\n\nSteve confronts Bucky inside the Helicarrier, trying to get through to his best friend by reminding him that millions could die. Unwilling to listen, Bucky continues to attack. Steve runs to grab the chip and replace it, but Bucky swipes it from him. Steve manages to wound both of Bucky's arms, then puts him in a headlock until he releases the chip. Steve rushes to place the chip into the system, but Bucky gets his hands on a gun and shoots him, badly wounding him. Despite the injuries, Steve still succeeds in installing the chip with just seconds left on the clock, calling Hill to override the Helicarriers. The targets go offline, to the surprise of the dumbfounded HYDRA agents. With the systems overridden, Hill has the Helicarriers open fire upon each other. One Helicarrier crashes into a dam beneath the Triskelion. The second crashes through the Triskelion, catching Rumlow in the process. Sam runs like hell out of the window as Natasha and Fury fly their chopper in time to catch him.\n\nThe third Helicarrier continues to fall with Steve and Bucky still inside. Steve chooses not to fight his friend, dropping his shield out of the Helicarrier. Bucky mercilessly punches him repeatedly across the face, even as Steve chooses to stick it out with him until the end, repeating the promise Bucky made to him, that \"he's with him to the end of the line\". This appears to snap Bucky out of his brainwashing, as he hesitates just as he's about to strike the fatal blow, remembering when he himself said those words. The Helicarrier crashes, throwing Steve out and sending him into the water below. He slips into unconsciousness, but not before seeing a hand reaching out for him. Bucky drags Steve to shore before walking away for good.\n\nIn the aftermath, Steve recovers in a hospital as Marvin Gaye's \"Trouble Man\" plays. He wakes up to hear the music, and Sam holding a bedside vigil for him. Meanwhile, Sharon applies for a posting as a field agent for the CIA. Hill interviews for a job with Stark Industries. The FBI arrest Senator Stern and other various corrupt officials who took bribes from HYDRA. Rumlow is also recovered from the wreckage, alive but with terrible facial burns. Natasha is brought before a committee hearing to answer for her ties to S.H.I.E.L.D. She defends herself by saying that even if they wanted to put her in prison, they could not because the council members know they need her and her allies. She coolly walks away. Meanwhile, Fury gets rids of any trace of his existence, including his passports and eyepatch, burning them for good.\n\nFury meets Steve and Sam at a cemetery at his own grave. On the headstone are Fury's name and the words \"The path of the righteous man....\" , from Ezekiel 25:17. Fury tells Sam and Steve that if anybody asks for him, they only need to come here to his grave.\n\nFury leaves as Natasha arrives to tell the guys this is Fury's way of saying \"Thank you.\" She hands Steve a file that he wanted, then suggests he ask out Sharon. Steve looks at the file, which concerns Bucky and his Winter Soldier transformation. Sam realizes that Steve is going to look for Bucky. Steve tells him that he doesn't have to go with him. Sam replies, \"I know. When do we start?\"\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Baron Wolfgang Von Strucker (Thomas Kretschmann) is discussing recent events with a fellow HYDRA scientist, Dr. List, in an underground HYDRA facility somewhere in eastern Europe. Even if the American factions of HYDRA have fallen, they have many other followers around the world keeping HYDRA's work going. Strucker in particular is overseeing experiments on human subjects with alien weaponry, including Loki's scepter. As they talk, Strucker and Dr. List decide to check on the two successes that their work has produced: fraternal twins Pietro (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen). He has superhuman speed, while she has telekinesis. Observing them, Von Strucker comments, \"It's not a world of spies anymore. Not even a world of heroes. This is the age of miracles, doctor. And there's nothing more horrifying than a miracle.\" The screen cuts to black as Wanda uses her powers to smash a pair of cinder blocks together.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, Bucky walks through the Captain America exhibit at the Smithsonian and comes across the display of himself. He stares at it pensively as he tries to remember his past life."

        "reviewText": "\"Captain America\" (1990) was just added to IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List....the one hundred worst rated major release films of all time. This is unusual, as this film did not (until now) have enough votes to make it elegible to join the ranks of awfulness. However, with the release of the latest Captain America film (\"Avengers: Endgame\"), apparently increased attention has been on this poor movie...hence it's inclusion. However, there is one huge problem with this....while \"Captain America\" is clearly a bad film, it is ridiculous to consider it's among the 100 worst ever. I wouldn't even place it in the bottom 1000....let alone 100.\n\nThe first portion of the movie is actually pretty good. You get the creation of the Captain as well as Red Skull....and up until Captain goes into suspended animation in the ice of Alaska, I thought I'd probably give the film a 4 or 5...maybe even a 6. But the final portion was just terrible. First, the Captain was saddled with a stupid sidekick who looked like an extra from the film \"Valley Girl\". She was weak and silly...and totally out of place. Second, the climactic final battle was terrible. If Captain America is a superhero....why was he so wimpy...not only in the final battle but all the ones leading up to it?! Third, while he tried hard, Matt Salinger was a dull Captain America...very dull. Add to this, fourth, a weak script with weak dialog. Overall, one of the worst superhero films I've seen...but nothing like truly godawful films like \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\" or \"Robot Monster\" (which, oddly, didn't even make the list).\n\nSo would I recommend this movie? Probably not...unless you are intensely curious or like seeing all of the Bottom100 films.",

        "reviewText": "After the Nazis have developed a process to turn an innocent boy into a super human entity, the Americans likewise experiment on average American youth Steve Rogers (Matt Salinger), who has polio. Steve develops incredible strength and resilience, is given a costume and shield, and is rechristened Captain America. The Cap fails spectacularly in his first mission, which is vanquishing Red Skull (Scott Paulin), the adult version of that Nazi experiment. He ends up frozen in Arctic ice for 47 years, reemerging in 1990 to do battle with the Red Skull once again.\n\nIt may be that this initial feature film vehicle for the legendary comic book hero (after two TV movies in the 1970s) will appeal more to casual viewers than longtime fans of the character. As it is, it lacks the spit and polish of major American product, and it will come off as cheesy and tacky to many viewers. Also, the scenario requires Steve to spend more time in civvies than in costume.\n\nBut this viewer didn't find it completely worthless; it's not without some amusements. Like the sight of the President (Ronny Cox), who'd glimpsed the Cap as a child, engaging in fisticuffs with various bad guys. Paulin is not a truly great villain, but he's a mild hoot anyway, and his minions include some very sexy (if inept) female assassins, including Red Skulls' own daughter (Francesca Neri). The action scenes won't blow the audience away, but they're adequate.\n\nThe main draw is a remarkably sincere Salinger, who makes for an appealing hero. Kim Gillingham, who gets an \"introducing\" credit, plays both Caps' lady friend and her daughter, and comes off better as the older lady. A variety of familiar faces - Ned Beatty, Michael Nouri, Darren McGavin, Melinda Dillon, Bill Mumy - are kind of wasted here, although McGavin at least gets a chance to be somewhat funny (it'd be a shame if he didn't).\n\nKids will likely be less judgmental than their adult counterparts, and might have some fun with it.\n\nFive out of 10.",

Red Skull still wishes to fulfil his plan of world domination by becoming the president of the United States. \n\nI went into this movie expecting to hate it since that seems to be the general consensus. What I saw was bad on many levels but not what I would call irredeemable.\n\nOn the positive side the production isn't too bad. The editing is passable except for those awful montage sequences. The cinematography and lighting is not what I would call inept. The acting is okay but the terrible writing makes for some awful line deliveries.\n\nHowever, this movie has quite possibly the worst superhero costume of all time, rivalled by the motorcycle helmet wearing Captain America from the 1979 TV movie. He seems to have prosthetic ears attached to his head and the wings makes his appearance seem comical. \n\nThe tone is also all over the place. You have Nazis and Germans executing people and at the same time you have a running gag where Captain America pretends to be car sick and hijacks cars. \n\nIt's bad in a cheesy way. I would say the Fantastic Four 1994 movie was miles better in being faithful to the source material while having an extremely low budget. However, as I said, I did find some little things enjoyable like the action, special effects and even production qualities. \n\nI think you will either hate it or find it as a harmless bit of cheesy entertainment and fun.",

When he comes back, he finds the Red Skull has assassinated Kennedy, King and has become one of the world's most powerful supervillains and businessmen. Can he stop the Skull now? \n\nThis film is fun if you like seeing a guy in a bad costume run around and throw a shield, while a man who looks and acts like Jimmy Carter is a crime-fighting president (and protector of the environment). It's light on plot, light on character development and even the action comes off as more cheesy than anything. But to be honest with you, this was more fun than almost any of the modern comic book films. (For example, \"Batman Begins\" is a phenomenal film -- but it's not as easy to sit back and laugh at with a beer.) \n\nWhy is the Red Skull Italian? As I recall from the comics, he's quite German, and there was no real reason to change this for the movie. I mean, if you're fighting the Nazis, isn't it just more logical to have the villain be German? Where did he get a daughter from? This remains unanswered. Other things seemed fishy... and even the decoder ring, which was important to the story, never paid off as fully as I would have liked (and what exactly did it decode?).\n\nIf you get a copy of this movie, keep your expectations low and your supply of Busch Light very high. Not a good movie, unless you love ripping apart such films. I do, so I loved it. But I wouldn't foist it anyone... but maybe the old \"Punisher\" film...",

It suffers from the same issues as the 1994 Fantastic Four, but unlike FF I can give it a, it's so bad it's good stamp (And I'm very happy about that).\n\nCaptain America is a pretty easy comic to adapt to the big screen, it's just an action adventure war movie about a guy who sometimes wears a mask. They did take some liberties with the character that make my Fanboy radar point up, but it's superficial.\n\nSteve Rodgers is now a boy from Southern California who has polio and offered himself up to the super soldier experiment headed up by a woman who escaped from the Nazis (The idea of a woman creating the star spangled avenger was cool, not enough female brainiacs in the comic book industry ).\n\nShortly after Steve Rodgers becomes Captain America the doctor is killed making Steve and The Red Skull the only one's like them. After stopping the Red Skull from destroying the White House he is trapped in Ice for 60 years and wakes up having to stop the Red Skull, who has formed an underground crime unit that basically is Hydra without saying it,again. \n\nProving how well Cap works as an action movie, Matt Salinger who plays Steve Rogers, wearing some sort of padding to make it look like he's got more than he does, barely wears the cartoonish suit they made for him (of course wearing the uniform makes him Captain America, duh)\n\nIt's got that 80s swagger to it. The Red Skull has his daughter do all the heavy lifting for most of the movie with her small army of rich Nazi brats who drive the fastest cars and wear the hottest fashions but more than capable with the guns.\n\nThey took some liberties with The Red Skull's origin too, I think this was to save money and film the entire movie in Italy (I'm also guessing that certain places in Italy look more like Southern California than New York City)\n\nI am being harsh on the movie because I've grown to like the character more now than I ever did when I was a kid and saw this, but like I expressed before, the movie does have a so bad it's food quality that makes it real enjoyable. \n\nhttp://cinemagardens.com",

        "reviewText": "Okay, so after watching the Republic serial from 1944 in which Captain America's alter ego was Grant Gardner, district attorney, and then two TV movie versions starring Reb Brown as Steve Rogers, occasional painter, I finally watched this 1990 version from Menahem Golan's 21st Century Film Corporation starring Matt Salinger as the super soldier from World War II that gets frozen for several decades before being thawed out. I liked the beginning where we find out about both his and The Red Skull's (Scott Paulin) early lives and there was a quite entertaining fight between them during the WWII sequence though it would have been nice to know what dastardly thing the Skull did that lead to that battle. But then we're abruptly taken to the present day to when Cap finds himself waking up to and it takes a little time to once again find some momentum. That said, having Ronny Cox and Ned Beatty as a couple of old pals now serving as president and reporter, respectively, was a nice treat for anyone who remembers them from Deliverance not to mention Beatty for his previous superhero encounter in the first two Christopher Reeve Superman movies. And how awesome it was to finally see the CA costume done right this time with both the wings on the cowl and the shield just the right size and color. Even more so was all the hot women that abounded though I have to wonder how any of them could realistically be daughters of the disfigured Red Skull! So in summation, this filmed version of Captain America may be a little on the underwhelming side concerning story logic but the action for the most part makes it worth it for at least one viewing though I probably wouldn't mind watching it again. Can't wait for Chris Evans in Captain America: The First Avenger later this summer.",

The reason for the kidnapping is that they need a test subject for an experiment which might allow them to create super-soldiers for their army and dreams of conquest. Yet, even though the experiment is a complete success, the doctor involved in it becomes horrified by the ruthlessness of those she works with and manages to escape to the United States with all of the secrets required to continue her work in her head. She then continues her research in the United States which eventually concludes with the making of a super-hero named \"Captain America\" (Matt Salinger) to counter the super-villain created in Italy who goes by the name of the \"Red Skull\" (Scott Paulin). Unfortunately, her success is short-lived as she is assassinated by Nazi agents and the secrets she had dies with her shortly afterward. But with war breaking out both Captain America and the Red Skull soon clash with each other and the story becomes even more pronounced after that. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say this the particular movie lacked the special effects of the more modern Captain America films which clearly resulted in an inferior picture by comparison. Even so, I didn't think the movie was necessarily bad as it still managed to entertain to a certain degree. That being said, I have rated this movie as about average and recommend it to those who enjoy films of this type.",

I was worried because it's produced in Yugoslavia in cooperation with Jadran Film, but from the result I suppose 21th Century Production and Marvel Entertainment had most of the work done. Movie is pretty much faithful to comics and Captain America's costume is just as it should be. Acting is decent, action is few, but when it comes it's well directed, and movie has nice comic-book atmosphere. There's no nudity, vulgarity or explicit violence, except for gunfights and common fist-fighting, so it's whole family friendly. There are few nicely done emotional scenes and just a bit of humor.

When I finally saw the video, I was disappointed with the story.  I did like the physical acting with Cap in costume, and I think that was the one true thing about Captain America. Rather than rant on about what was wrong, let me tell you Hollywood scripters how to do it right;\n\n1. The first movie must spend a great deal (if not the whole movie) in WWII, where his legend will start.  No urban legend in the 21st Century.\n\n2.  Steve Rogers is a NEW YORKER! He kept his optimism despite losing both parents to disease (alcoholism, pneumonia) during the Great Depression. Even in the new millennium, he loves listening to big band and 40s music and anything that sparks such nostalgia.  He's still a BROOKLYN Dodgers fan.\n\n3. What the hell was that with the plastic ears?! (Sorry, had to get that one out.)\n\n4. Get that shield back...it was way better than not having one in the serial (a gun?) or a clear one in the TV movie.\n\n5. Don't forget that the costume has a star on the front *and* back.\n\n6. If you make the Red Skull (most likely villain) Italian again, so help me...\n\n7. I wouldn't mind seeing Bucky, but you can do like the Ultimates storyline and have him non-costumed in the war if it'll help.  But please don't make Cap's costume like the one in the Ultimates (either version).\n\n8. Don't try to combine love interests (Bernie was the girlfriend during the 1980s, Sharon was the girl in the 60s and 70s, but it was wrong to make them mother and daughter.).\n\n9. I gotta say it again...don't make him an urban legend like Batman! Captain America was created to be a symbol and INSPIRE American public and forces as a response against the Red Skull.  He can't do that if he's skulking the shadows.\n\nThanks and good luck.",

Salinger) in the title role, Ronny Cox, Ned Beatty, and Scott Paulin as Cap's nemesis, \"The Red Skull\".\n\nSure this movie's ridiculed now, but as a child growing up in the 1990s it was this, or literally nothing. Superhero movies weren't the box office blockbusters they are today, and as such this film was quite the novelty back then.\n\nNow you can walk into any store and find tons of Marvel merchandise, but it was a different story in the early-to-mid nineties. It was a lot harder to find anything Marvel related, but thankfully times have changed and people now see comics as great resources for turning out highly entertaining films. Truly, kids don't know how lucky they have it now.\n\nSure, this movie had more than its fair share of flaws including transforming Red Skull from the German Nazi of his comic continuity into an Italian fascist for the film version, a choice I'm still puzzled by. Taking two of Captain America's unrelated love interests from different eras and making them mother and daughter in the film also seemed an odd decision, but what seemed utterly unforgivable to me as a kid was the costume designer who forgot to put a star on both the front AND back of Cap's uniform! The one thing they got right on the money was his shield.\n\nComic fans are an interesting bunch, and I'm proud to call myself one of them, and one thing that drives us all mad is taking liberties with the source material. I think had this movie tried to stay closer to its comic book roots it wouldn't have been criticized so harshly.\n\nPersonally, I believe had the filmmakers focused on making this story more of a period piece set in the 1940s during the height of World War II, I think the end result would have been a lot better. It would've given us the chance to see why Captain America was considered an American legend and war hero. As it was, it seemed the screenwriter was more focused on trying to propel the story into what was then present day. I would say that maybe roughly fifteen minutes, if that, takes place in 1943 while the rest of the movie takes place in 1993.\n\nIn conclusion, I'd say that \"Captain America\" isn't a great movie, but it's not that bad, and before you rip it to shreds, try to remember the time period from which it came. A time when comic book movies weren't the norm, and kids were happy to have something like this to watch.\n\nIf you're curious to watch it I'd say you probably won't be able to find this on DVD and certainly not Blu Ray, but check around on online auctions websites for used VHS copies, or any other popular video streaming sites where I know it's available to watch for free.\n\nI'll be curious to see Captain America: The First Avenger when it comes to theaters in 2011, with Chris Evans (formerly the \"Human Torch\" from the two abysmal \"Fantastic Four\" movies) taking on the mantle of Captain America.",

        "reviewText": "Before 1998's \"Blade,\" Marvel Comics couldn't seem to catch a break when it came to movie versions of their different properties. In the wake of \"Iron Man 3\" and \"The Avengers,\" I know that's very hard to believe. There was a serial for Captain America released in 1944 through Republic Pictures. George Lucas executive produced a live-action adaptation of \"Howard the Duck\" in 1986.\n\nThe next few years up to Wesley Snipes' take on the legendary vampire slayer were plagued with low-budget versions of the comic book publisher's characters. Dolph Lundgren's \"The Punisher\" couldn't even muster a theatrical release in the U.S. Roger Corman's \"The Fantastic Four\" never officially saw the light of day anywhere, although bootleg copies float around.\n\n21st Century Film Corporation released \"Captain America\" straight to video in the middle of those two disasters. For many years, the movie was hard to get a hold of and only released on VHS. Shout! Factory released it on DVD and made it widely available to those who sought it out for so many years as a sort of Nerd Holy Grail.\n\nSeveral years after being caught by Red Skull and left for dead, Steve Rogers is found frozen in the ice and thawed out. He discovers Red Skull received plastic surgery to hide his true identity and is heading up a group of world leaders set on kidnapping the President of the United States for their own diabolical ambitions.\n\nIs \"Captain America\" filled with cheese? If you judge it from a modern standpoint, of course it is. If you look at it as being a piece of World War II propaganda filmed in the 1940s, you'll find it totally hits its mark. That's the standpoint I choose to view it from.\n\nMy only real issue is that we only get about 5 minutes of face time from the real Red Skull. The rest of the film features actor Scott Paulin in flesh-colored make-up topped with scar lines. It's a real letdown for fans of the Red Skull who wanted to see the character the way he looks in the comic books.\n\nI still think that \"Captain America\" gets way more flack for being cheesy and low budget than it deserves. Is it on the same quality level as \"Captain America: The First Avenger?\" No way! However, it has an inviting and personal flavor to it that still works 23 years later. Real comic book fans will find value in this adaption and appreciate it for what it is.",

Okay, so the director is Albert Pyun, who I have to say is one of my least favourites, and the paucity of budget is evident throughout, but other than that this is surprisingly watchable.\n\nI think it's fair to say that Matt Salinger is one of the more wooden superhero actors to be seen on screen, but the supporting cast makes up for that. THE HIDDEN's Michael Nouri shows up as a military man, good old Ronny Cox is the President no less, Ned Beatty ISN'T a bad guy, and there's even a part for TV's one time Kolchak, Darren McGavin.\n\nIt's a fast paced little movie that takes in Steve Rogers' origins, sends him through time to the modern day and then involves him in a plot involving an old enemy. Not much of it makes too much sense, but there's plenty of action and scenes of our hero battling the bad guys. Pyun's direction is horrible, but I was expecting the worst when I sat down to watch this and I didn't get it.",

As such, many film buffs who know little or nothing about Captain America have no doubt been picking this one up at the video store. Too bad nothing but pure crapulescence awaits them.\n\nWhere to begin? The movie has a dim look to it; the acting is second-rate; and the action and battle scenes are few and far between. It will disappoint most die-hard comic book fans, perhaps as much as those silly 1970s Cap films were. On a positive note, the action scenes aren't awful when the viewer finally gets to them.

        "reviewText": "Half-way decent adaptation of the classic Marvel comics character, which many people either love or hate. Most of the half-way decency the film has it derives from star Matt Salinger, the son of over-praised asshole writer JD Salinger. In a role that could have been made comical or just plain bad by many other actors, Matt manages to imbue the character with an authentic feeling of sincerity similar to what Christopher Reeve gave to Superman and often missing from other actors in superhero films. Had this film been left with a bigger budget and gotten a big theatrical release it could very well have made Matt Salinger a star, or at least establish his name and allow him some leverage to pursue other roles in bigger projects like Helen Slater after the endearingly classic disaster \"Supergirl\" (1984). Actually I think both Dolph Lundgren and Arnold Schwarzenegger, respectively, were both considered for this role, but it's just as well that they didn't get it, seeing as how their accents would have worked against them playing this \"All-American\" hero. Although Arnold's name on the picture might have gotten it a theatrical release instead of going direct to video (a similar fate befell Dolph's \"The Punisher\").\n\nAfter Steve Rogers gets pumped up by the super soldier serum he becomes Captain America and gets into a disastrous first mission that ends with him getting his ass kicked by the Red Skull, who straps him to a missile pointed at the White House. Cap narrowly manages to cut off the Red Skull's hand and wrecks the missile so that instead of hitting the White House it lands in the Arctic and freezes him there, but not before he is spotted by a little boy who grows up to be President Ronny Cox. When Cap thaws out, he finds that much has changed while he's been gone, like his old girlfriend and her now adult daughter. He also finds out that the Red Skull is still alive and still out to conquer the world. Naturally, Captain America catches up with the Red Skull and beats the crap out of him in turn (\"Stop calling me your brother!\") before saving the world.\n\nThe guy playing the Skull is ineffectual, but he's got a nice looking daughter. Again, the real saving grace here is Matt Salinger's sincere performance as the title character, but even that can only do so much against a weak script and boring villains. Still, I enjoyed this film and I feel that fans deserved a chance to see this in theaters. And now I hear that Brad Pitt wants to play Captain America! Oh the shame...",

It doesn't rely on over-the-top special effects and overblown action scenes. Instead, this is a thinking man's superhero movie, focusing on the power of the characters to show what true heroes are.\n\nCaptain America and the Red Skull are counterparts, both representing the pride of their countries, America and Germany, respectively, back in WW2. Both have been shot with a super-serum which transforms them into world-class athletes. They fight, Cap loses and is tied to a runaway rocket, which crashes into Alaska. He is preserved there until the 1990's, when he get resurrected and he realizes Red Skull is still alive and healthy, because the serum has allowed him to last this long. He is responsible for the deaths of several historic figures, including Robert Kennedy, John Kennedy, and Martin Luther King. And his next target is the newest U.S. president. Cap must stop him before it is too late, and at the same time, he must come to grips with the fact that he is in a strange new world and everything he has ever known in gone forever, and that if it hadn't been for him failing to defeat Skull the first time, many people would still be alive.\n\nThe Red Skull, also, hates what he has become, and Captain America resurfacing represents a part of him he wishes was dead. He therefore takes all measures to make sure Cap is killed. The way they constantly pursue each other is both exciting and moving.\n\nAs someone mentioned, this is a great deal like \"Forever Young,\" especially the way Cap comes back to life and finds his girlfriend extremely old. And \"Cap\" is the better of the two movies. It has a government-conspiracy plot worthy of a Dean Koontz novel, and it also throws in a lot of comic-book silliness.

Armed men enter the house, kidnap the boy, and execute his entire family. The boy has been chosen as a test subject for a secret project to create a super-soldier. The process has been created by scientist, Dr. Maria Vaselli, and has so far only be tested on animals. A rat gained enhanced intelligence and physical properties, though it gained an unusual red color.\n\nWhen the process on Tadzio is about to begin, Vaselli first witnesses the cruel treatment of the boy. She protests about it, and she is almost arrested. She manages to escape, though she hears Tadzio's screams from a distance. The boy has been mutated, and will grow to become the villainous Red Skull.\n\nIn 1943, Vaselli works for the United States and has created an improved version of the super-soldier process, code-named Operation: Rebirth. The first human test subject chosen for the process is Steve Rogers of Redondo Beach, California. He is a patriotic young man, who walks with a limp because of polio. In Redondo Beach, Steve is about to depart, saying goodbye to his widowed mother and his friends. He also has a private talk with his girlfriend Bernice \"Bernie\" Stewart, who promises to wait for his return.\n\nThe process to mutate Steve Rogers takes place in a secret laboratory, hidden in the basement of a nondescript diner. A small crowd of officials witnesses the process. One of them is actually a foreign spy. The process is a success, and the spy congratulates Dr. Vaselli. He then shoots at her, and continues firing around. An enhanced Steve Rogers manages to kill the spy, though he is shot three times in the process. Vaselli dies in Rogers' arms while expressing her hopes for him. The wounded Rogers falls unconscious.\n\nRogers quickly recovers in a hospital, and the military starts training him for his first mission as Captain America. He is given a bullet-proof suit designed by Dr. Vaselli, although he is not impressed by its lack of camouflage features. He is given a specially designed shield as his primary weapon. Following a brief period of training, Captain America is transported to Italy by a military aircraft. He feels that he should have more training.\n\nThe authorities in Italy have created a prototype intercontinental ballistic missile, and the Red Skull is about to fire it against the White House. Captain America infiltrates the facility, and meets the Skull for the first time. In a battle between them, the Skull uses his superior training to defeat Cap. He ties Cap to the missile, but Cap soon grabs one of the Skull's hands. The Skull cuts his own hand with a knife in order to escape. The missile is fired.\n\nIn Washington D.C., young Thomas Kimball does not want to sleep. He sneaks away from his sleeping parents, and prepares to photograph the White House. Just as the missile is about to hit its target, Cap manages kicks one of the missile's fins and changes its course. Kimball is the only witness to the event and gets a close-range photograph of Cap. The missile eventually falls in Alaska, and Captain America is frozen in ice.\n\nShortly after, Thomas Kimball has returned to his hometown of Springfield, Ohio. He discusses what he witnessed with his best friend Sam Kolawetz. The two boys try to determine the identity of the hero in the photograph. They decide that the man was neither Namor the Sub-Mariner, nor the Human Torch. But they don't have a clue who Cap was.\n\nThe following scenes follow Thomas Kimball's life though the following decades. He becomes the town's local hero, serves in war, starts a political career, and is eventually elected President of the United States. In 1993, Kimball wants to sign an environmental treaty and introduce new pro-environmentalist legislation, to face a global crisis. His ideas anger corrupt General Fleming, and other representatives of the the military-industrial complex. They have a secret meeting in Italy to discuss the situation. The Red Skull has become a businessman and crime lord, and leads this meeting. He refuses to assassinate President Kimball, pointing out that he had orchestrated previous political assassinations who turned their victims into martyrs. He instead wants to turn Kimball into a convenient puppet ruler.\n\nMeanwhile in Alaska, a West German research team discovers the frozen Captain America. While examining the block of ice, they accidentally revive Cap. He mistakes them for Nazi agents, because they speak in German. He flees from them, but one of them manages to photograph him. Captain America's picture is printed in several newspapers. Thomas Kimball recognizes the mystery man from his past and informs his best friend, newspaper journalist Sam Kolawetz. Kolawetz intends to find the mystery man. Meanwhile the Skull learns of \"his brother\"'s (as he calls Cap) return. He assigns his daughter and chief assassin Valentina de Santis to find and eliminate Cap.\n\nKolawetz finds Captain America wandering on foot in northern Canada, and helps him escape from Valentina and her henchmen. He informs Cap about the events of the last 50 years, but Cap does not believe him. Cap steal's Kolawetz's car and starts a long journey back to California. He arrives in Redondo Beach in hopes of reconnecting with his family and friends. He finds the city and its people have changed a lot. He locates Bernie's house, and is surprised to find that she is an old woman. He meets Bernie's husband, and their adult daughter Sharon. He learns that Bernie waited for him until 1959, and then married. Cap realizes that he has been missing for 50 years.\n\nUsing past information on Project Rebirth , gathered over many years, Kolawetz manages to locate Bernie and approaches her for information on Steve Rogers. Unknown to him, he was being tracked by Valentina and her henchmen. Valentina shouts Kolawetz and Bernie's husband. She then violently interrogates Bernie, and eventually kills her in cold blood. Steve and Sharon soon learn about what happened, and realize that the Red Skull is responsible.\n\nCap manages to locate Dr. Vaselli's abandoned laboratory and retrieves her private diary. They find some clues on the Red Skull's identity, though Vaselli did not know Tadzio's real name. Meanwhile, President Kimball is abducted from a hotel in Rome. Red Skull starts planning to turn Kimball into a mind-controlled puppet.\n\nCap and Sharon travel to Portovenera, search the formed home of the de Santis family, and discover a sound recording of the executions. They are located and attacked by Valentina and her henchmen. Sharon allows herself to be captured, to allow Cap to escape. Cap infiltrates the castle of the Red Skull, while Kimball and Sharon escape their cells.\n\nRed Skull is confronted by failure and plans to commit suicide. He plans to detonate a nuclear weapon, which will exterminate all life in Southern Europe. He is killed in a final battle with Cap, before he has time to detonate the weapon. Cap also uses his shield to take down Valentina. The released President Kimball signs the environmental treaty. The film ends."

It is gritty, depressing and not a fun movie at all.\n\nThis isn't your usual comic book movie, it's a detective movie, with more in common with Se7en, than previous Batman movies. The first two thirds of the movie are amazing, at one point I turned to my son and said \"This is a masterpiece\" everything works and is brilliant, I was 100% enthralled, but boy does it drop the ball in the final act.\n\nOf the cast Pattinson is great, Collin Farrell is ok, Zoe Kravitz was fine too, but she has zero chemistry with Pattinson (Keaton and Pfeiffer they are not), Paul Dano though, was incredible, especially in the scene in Arkham, whilst Geoffrey Wright is as great as he always is.\n\nOn the downside, It does have some pacing issues, and is really too long (though I'm not sure what I'd cut), and I really wasn't keen on the ending (I don't know if it is a comic book storyline they did), as I think the final act really lets the movie down!! It's here, in the final act, that you feel the movies run time!!\n\nI was surprised there were only 36 other people in my screening.",

        "reviewText": "I have been absolutely fizzing to see 'The Batman' from the day it was announced, but even more so from when I first heard it described as being inspired by 'Se7en' - one of my favourite psychological thrillers of all time. Were we finally going to get the raw and gritty Batman film I'd always dreamed of seeing? We certainly were.\n\nWhere to begin? The biggest thing that struck me with this film was just how much time we got to spend with Batman, as Batman. There is very little of Bruce Wayne in this movie and I'm absolutely fine with that. The movie is Batman's story and we are with him from start to finish. We even get some narration from him, which I'm not quite sure how I feel about just yet. It was very good narration but I'm not sure he's a character I want it from.\n\nThe Riddler in this movie is phenomenal. After The Joker in 'The Dark Knight' this is absolutely my second favourite Batman film villain. He was clearly inspired by the Zodiac killer and what an inspired choice. Also the use of the riddles in the film is nothing short of genius. These are very clever riddles and puzzles and make Batman have to do some serious detective work - something I've always wanted more of from him in the previous films.\n\nThis is my favourite incarnation of Catwoman to date. I haven't loved her character's place in the films in the past. I've found she slows everything down and brings out a dull side of Batman that I haven't enjoyed. In this film though she was used perfectly. She's the love interest and a villain/anti-hero all in one. That is massive because it saves another thing that can often bog down a Batman film - the pointless love interest.\n\nThe Penguin was probably the one letdown for me. From what I'd seen in the trailer I suspected this may be the case. I'm wondering if they were using this movie as a set-up for him and then in the second film he will evolve and have a lot more to do. In this one though I just found him quite a dull screen-presence.\n\nRobert Pattinson as Batman blew me away. He looked great and his voice was perfect. He was extremely intense and very menacing. Even though I knew he was more than capable of playing the role, I think I still needed to see the end product just for confirmation that he had what it takes. He absolutely did and then some.\n\nThe film has quite a unique feel. There are scenes and sequences in this film that would feel out of place in both Tim Burton's Batman universe and Christopher Nolan's universe. But then there are little aspects from each of their respective films which clearly inspired parts of 'The Batman'. It basically took the best things from each of them and then twisted them into it's own style - while obviously adding a lot of its own stuff also. It's very well done in that sense.\n\nThe Batmobile in this movie is awesome. There's just no other way to put it. The sound it made and the vibrations it sent through my cinema chair were bone-chilling. The chase sequence in this movie with The Penguin is one of the best I've ever seen.\n\nThe film is long at just under 3 hours but it really never feels like it. There's a short period in the middle of the movie where everything slows down for a little while. That really is the only flat part of the movie however. The rest happens at a break-neck pace.\n\nIt's hard to find enough good things to say about this movie. I need to see it again and digest a couple of things for a little longer, but for now I have it firmly sitting in second place behind 'The Dark Knight' in my order of favourite Batman films. 10/10.",

How did it take this long for him to get a role like this?) targets public officials, revealing their corruption, and killing them in gruesome fashion(how did this get away with a PG-13 again? Oh, right, as long as you don't show the details, then you can get away with almost anything, by now. Even a barely toned down Jigsaw). In order to stop him, it will be necessary for the Bat and the Cat(with amazing chemistry), together, to stop the rat. Thanks, Matt.\n\nI really did not think that we needed yet another film dealing with Bruce Wayne's alter-ego. How about Nightwing? I know it's not likely, but part of me still holds out hope that Grayson will be turned into a feature(if you've never checked out the trailer on YouTube, you're missing out). But somehow, this managed to convince me. Fingers crossed for at least one sequel. Robert Pattinson is incredible here. Seriously, can we just stop freaking out every time the role is recast? The closest we've come to someone who shouldn't be doing it is George Clooney, and it's not like anybody came out of that flick looking good. He took that job after doing From Dusk till Dawn. There was good reason to think that he was going to be badass. Honestly, everyone here gives a strong performance.\n\nSomething that will definitely appeal to some more than others, is the genre and tone. This is essentially Se7en meets Zodiac. It is not paced like a typical massive blockbuster. While the action is great, especially the martial arts, not to mention that car chase, there's less of it and it is smaller scale than for example the Nolan trilogy(which also has far more escalation). Essentially, this just isn't focused that much on that aspect of the titular icon. And I think we can all agree that we've had some great entries that deliver that. This is more interested in conveying to the audience that there's a reason he's called the world's greatest detective. We've barely seen it outside of the animated ones before, so I'm very happy with that choice by them.\n\nIn addition to what I've already mentioned, this features some drugs, suggestive material and strong language. I recommend this to any fan of Batman. 9/10.",

        "reviewText": "STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * Awful\n\nGotham City is rocked by a series of murders of key political figures, by a sadistic killer calling himself The Riddler (Paul Dano), who holds the city to ransom, revealing darkly guarded secrets and threatening more mayhem until he is stopped. 'The Batman' (Robert Pattinson), the alter ego of millionaire Bruce Wayne, starts an investigation of his own, crossing paths with a woman called Selina Kyle (Zoe Kravitz), who operates as 'Catwoman' and wants to find out what happened to her friend. It sets them both on a collision course with the darkest elements of Gotham's underworld, including notorious gangster 'The Penguin' (an unrecognisable Colin Farrell) and crime boss Carmine Falcone (John Turturro), who may be sitting on a devastating secret that could shatter both their lives.\n\nThe Batman series must be one of the most enduringly successful franchises in the world of comic book films, appearing in various different incarnations since its original creation. Here, writer/director Matt Reeves delivers a mammoth three hour long interpretation of his own of the character that many seem to be hailing as the best ever. Less doesn't seem to be more anymore, at least not to the cinema artistes, but from this end, all I can see is a film drowning in its own indulgence.\n\nReeves is obviously keen to maintain the bleak, heavy tone established by Christopher Nolan, and so we have a Gotham City with seemingly endless heavy rain, and gloomy skies, set against Pattinson's dark, brooding stare and gravelly voiceovers, set to the background of the emo rock soundtrack. It's just one of many things ripe for parody in a film that takes itself much too seriously and feels almost devoid of any humour and light. Even more overdone is Dano's dark 'Riddler', operating in some garish gimp suit that just looks ridiculous. Thrown in to this is the topical 'social justice' speeches that litter film and TV today, with Kravitz's Catwoman even praising the 'sinister' villain (who we're meant to hate!) at one point, for killing 'all these white privileged a$$holes.' It's just trying to cram a whole load of eggs in to one basket, over ambitious and overlong, and by the time of the main villain's grand 'master plan' at the end, you're too overwhelmed (or bored) to care.\n\nEveryone else can think what they like, but personally this is one of the most pretentious Batman's ever, which might have been a bit more bearable if it had just been less self indulgent, or at least had an old fashioned, Lawrence of Arabia style 'intermission' at some point. **",

        "reviewText": "I'm not sure where to begin as I don't generally want to spoil the reveals, but the big twists in the film were very anticlimactic. For 'The Batman'; Matt Reeves seemed to borrow from some of the bigger books such as 'Batman: Year One', 'Hush', and 'Batman: The Long Halloween'. Reeves also leaned heavily onto films such as 'The French Connection', 'Zodiac', and the noir classic 'Chinatown'. The general feel of the movie sought to relate Batman in the detective role that he's famous for in the comics, but unfortunately ignores any attempt at Batman's level of crime & mystery.\n\nThe acting was really good. There's a great cast of professionals in this film, although Robert Patterson isn't allowed a range of emotion. Bruce Wayne and Batman are completely indistinguishable as the tired emo-kid who walks through life with severe lethargy. Colin Farrell is unrecognizable as the Penguin, and dare I say gave the greatest performance of his life. A large portion of the film is writing out a semi-origin story for Oswald Cobblepot and his rise to become Gotham's crime boss. A lot of the villains are the origin stories here. Batman (the character) is basically introduced the way he is in 'Batman: Year Two' and I thought that was a mistake. Year one of Batman would have been wonderful on screen. The audience seeing Bruce Wayne learning to use fear in his early days would have been a relief to this movie's \"Everyone is just scared of him.\" plot device. Zoe Kravitz's performance as Selena Kyle becoming Cat Woman was under-developed, as she was so much fun to watch in 'The Batman' that I'd like to see this spin-off into a stand-alone Cat Woman release. Jeffery Wright was brilliant (of course) even remaining quiet in the Batman's background he pulled the attention onto himself, mostly because Patterson's portrayal was incredibly stiff. Paul Dano as The Riddler was exactly what I wanted to see in this movie. The character reached a new level of applause as a serial killer, but saddly that part of the plot was put on the back burner for the lackluster crime drama with Carmine Falcone. John Turturro was great as the crime boss Falcone, but the plot focused too long on his side story rather than offering more clues about the killings. It dragged on so long that it bored me completely. I went into 'The Batman' to see him match wits with a clever serial killer, not be re-educated about the connection between Thomas Wayne & Carmine Falcone again.\n\nThe action sequences with the car chases and the fight choreography seemed old fashioned in a way. I knew before hand that Reeves lifted from some older better known films, but it's as if they dropped the budget on these scenes. Batman racing to catch the Penguin was an old muscle car Batmobile versus (what I'm guessing was) a 1980's Buick. I was laughing at this chase scene... it was presented with such seriousness that maybe if Penguin were in an expensive Italian sports car, I might have enjoyed it. But it was literally a supped-up car desperately trying to out pace my mom's car. The fighting was dull. Hand to hand combat is one of the first things Bruce Wayne learns before donning the cowl. But in this movie Batman is throwing punches a newly trained boxer would scoff at. So much of these scenes were empty and devoid of thrills and chills, that I wondered where the editor was.\n\n'The Batman' is simply too long. It's a ridiculous attempt to impress fans of it's own significance. It fails at cohesive story-telling and it basically pats itself on the back throughout the unnecessary musical score. Unlike the Dark Knight before it - I won't watch it again.",

It's a mostly well-made film and a good addition to the franchise. And the Bat suit looks awesome.\n\nAt the same time, nothing about this movie wowed me.

This needed at least 20 mins cut out and much faster storytelling.

He wasn't convincing and his monotonic whispering dialogue and Emo demeanor was very lackluster to the point of cringeworthy. And that's him both as Batman and even more so as Bruce Wayne.\n\nAnd what's with Colin Farrell being cast with all these prosthetics to play the Penguin? Was every other actor that naturally has that character's look unavailable? It's not like Farrell has a particular set of Penguin skills lol. Casting Farrell as Batman and Pattinson as Penguin, now that would've worked much better imo.\n\nI'm also a big fan of Westworld's Jeffrey Wright, but here again, he was very unconvincing as Gordon, especially when he also had that monotonic whispering Emo demeanor. I get that director and joint writer Reeves was going for that dark lonely dreary theme, but instead, the characters looked bored and inexperienced actors with sore throats.\n\nThe only one that nailed their character perfectly was the lovely and beautiful Kravitz, who stole the entire show. I would've rather watched a 4+ hour movie with just her as Catwoman.\n\nAll the Affleck, Keaton, Bale, Kilmer and even Clooney Batman characters were much more convincing, as well as having more and better \"keep you awake\" action in said films.\n\nSadly, this one is a generous yet disappointing 6/10 from me.",

The opening scenes with The Batman made me think, I was going to have another Heath moment and be forced to eat my words because those opening scenes are indeed something special.\n\nBut then the film gets going. Part \"Saw\" rip-off and so desperately wants to be \"Se7en\" in its execution, the story dragged. You don't care about any of the characters and I found myself pining for Clooney and his bat-nipples and Mr. Freeze.\n\nWhat I found really funny though is the producer of this utter mess got in touch with Nolan and warned him, \"We're going to make a better Batman than you.\" No. Just no.\n\nLike the last Lord of The Rings film, this has an ending that just keeps on coming. Something wraps up and you start to get ready to leave, the film continues. Something else is wrapped up and you think, \"That's it...\" and it keeps going.... Something else, and on and on and on...\n\nI can see why the guy in the seat nearby racked up a massive line of coke and snorted it midway through (and no, I'm not joking... Welcome to Southampton).\n\nWith regards to the plank of wood.... Sorry... \"Pattison\". In the initial scenes I was genuinely excited. Never a fan of his costume before, seeing it here - suddenly I \"got it\". He proper beats down on someone in a vicious attack. They get back up... In fact, everyone he bat-punches gets back up and just attacks him from behind again. There's no real threat here. When Bale smacked someone down, they stayed dead. But then, when Bale stripped off (same as Affleck), they were built. Robert looked like me and I look like Mr. Burns from The Simpsons. A skeletal mess with no beef there whatsoever. In fact, when Robert bent over in one topless scene, his bones stuck out and I thought wings were going to pop out. But then, why wouldn't they when he infamously said he refused to bulk up for the role (I would have sacked him there and then).\n\nHis time as Bruce is strictly limited - thank God - so you can't really judge him for that. As Bruce he just stands there and looks confused. As The Batman, by the end he became a parody. His Batman voice changed to the same sound as the joke Batman in the college humour videos (A is for Alfred = genius). When he was mad, it just look like he was pulling a cum-face. And don't even get me started on the Adrian Mole diary keeping that's going in with the voice-over narration.\n\nHonestly, with the exception of the opening ten minutes or so, I have never hated a film so much as I did this and given I went in with low expectations, even I am surprised at how fuming I am at myself for wasting my time on it.",

This movie's rote serial-killer plot indulges in every single one of the irritating tropes that Nolan already played around with, most notably the 'but he wanted to be captured!' eye-roller. (Also irritating are Reeves' cheap attempts to desecrate Schubert's music while indulging the trope of the classical music-loving psychopath). Modern culture's obsession with and inadvertent glorification of serial killers is one of my greatest pet peeves---they are just pathetic and boring characters who are all the same. Exchange the Riddler for any of the killers in Fincher's movies and there is basically no difference. And it irritated me to no end how practically every character allowed themselves to fall prey to the Riddler's petty mind games- - if I was there I would promptly tell him to p*ss off and take his stupid video calls elsewhere, even if there was a bomb strapped to my neck.\n\nSecondly, the casting is sometimes bizarre. DC has often thrived on unorthodox casting-if they can make Ben Affleck work as Batman anything goes-but they trip up here since we have the high-water mark of the Nolan trilogy to compare it to. Andy Serkis as Alfred? That completely does not work; he just lacks the sophistication of Michael Caine. The new Commissioner Gordon is no Gary Oldman, that's for sure. The Riddler joins the swelling ranks of villains desperately trying to imitate Heath Ledger. (The Riddler from the '66 Batman show was vastly superior--heck, Jim Carrey was). The new Catwoman is alright given the rest of this casting, but is rendered irritating by a script that causes here to carry ON and ON about some friend of hers that ends up killed. Why she's so emotionally attached to this friend is a mystery not even Batman dares solve. The closest thing to a saving grace is the infamously unrecognizable Colin Farrell as the Penguin--- the car chase scene was great even as I kept wondering why none of the vehicles were hydroplaning with something like a full inch of water on the road.\n\nThirdly, the pacing is off. I've seen people accuse Nolan of being portentous, but The Batman takes it to a whole new level with it's bloated runtime. It doesn't even have the quasi-grandeur of the Snyder Cut due to the banal serial killer story which mostly requires people to pop in and out of the Penguin's club ad nauseam. Reeves said that he was supposedly inspired by Alfred Hitchcock, but other than a 'Rear Window' throwback in the opening scene I don't see it. The film is mostly shot like a generic TV procedural filtered through a David Fincher lens, and Reeves completely lacks the morbid playfulness that made Hitchcock so sublime. (Compare any Riddler murder to the one in 'Dial M for Murder', which is one of the more mediocre Hitchcocks). Reeve's sole technique for suspense is to have the Riddler hovering around in the background while an unsuspecting victim putters about.\n\nUgh. If any good this would have become DC's highest grossing film ever. As it is, people will lose interest after a little while and the box office receipts will drop.",

        "reviewText": "The Batman (2022) is a movie my wife and I caught an advanced screening of last night. The storyline follows Gotham shortly after \"The Batman\" has emerged and established himself in the streets. A serial killer known as The Riddler starts a killing spree of everyone influential within Gotham's hierarchy until Bruce Wayne in inevitably the target. How are all of these people tied together and can Batman tie the pieces together before Wayne is the next victim?\n\nThis movie is directed by Matt Reeves (Cloverfield) and stars Robert Pattinson (Twilight), Zo√´ Kravitz (Kimi), Colin Farrell (Total Recall), Paul Dano (There Will be Blood), John Turturro (Do the Right Thing), Peter Sarsgaard (Garden State), Andy Serkis (Lord of the Rings), Jeffrey Wright (Shaft) and Barry Keoghan (Eternals).\n\nThe storyline, look and feel of this movie is an A+. The characters are perfectly cast and well executed. Farrell, Dano and Kravitz were a 10/10.\n\nThis movie does a fantastic job of depicting the Batman universe with the appropriate grit and feel and the lighting and cinematography is excellent. This also did a good job of creating various potential spinoffs with some subtle references within the storyline and at the end. This has a very good Jeph Loeb comics feel to it and does a good job delivering the \"Detective\" elements of Batman. The violence was also brilliant and very well done. I will say this did not need to be 3-hours and there are an abundance of scenes that could have been better edited. This film likely should have been a hair under 2 and a half hours.\n\nOverall this is a magnificent addition to the super hero genre and an absolute must see for Batman fans. I would score this a 7.5- 8/10 and strongly recommend it.",

Filmmaker Matt Reeves pulls out all the stops in this even darker adaptation of the Bob Kane comic book hero with Pattinson standing tall and brooding as Bruce Wayne employing vigilante style justice as The Caped Cursader while Gotham quakes under the siege of the homicidal Riddler (Dano affectively disturbing) and gaining an unlikely ally in Selina Kyle (ass-kicking Kravitz in pre-Catwoman mode). Arresting visuals thanks in large part to ace cinematography by Greig Fraser and James Chinlund's production design all aided by the foreboding score by Michael Giacchino full of bombast and dread. Farrell, under a ton of unrecognizable prosthetics, has a field day in getting in touch with his inner Robert De Niro as The Penguin. By all means see it in IMAX!",

I was looking over my shoulder to see of anyone else was laughing at what cringe this movie delivers.\n\nThe actors in this were one of the highlights excluding the villain (the riddler) and the Batman. Penguin was by far the coolest and best actor. Honestly a good fellas type character. All other supporting actors were also quite good. I however think Robert pattinson a horrible pick for Batman. The whole time he seems like a really awkward and sad goth kid, I was half expecting him to say \"gosh get outta my room\". Absolutely trash acting The riddler was even worse! He was the major cringe factor in this movie with awful and dorky video calls where he is super non intimidating and laughable. His video calls reminded me of the horror films my 15 year old class mates had made in high school, their budgets were $0.\n\nThe relationship between the Batman and cat woman was my only other plus in this movie. The romance was quite sweet and had a lot of tension. They rode around In their awesome motorcycles just roaring through the town it was really cute.\n\nThe bat mobile was pretty awesome but definitely very weird for a Batman film. The old classic camaro was a little spine chilling not gonna lie.\n\nNow to answer everyone's questions I do think Robert pattinson was a terrible choice for Batman for a few reasons. At first I had no qualms but watching the film made me believe he was a bad and cringey actor for the role, he just isn't a badass over masculine kinda guy, like at all. He seems awkward and it shows. His voice wasn't that great, his body was not very big nor muscular like many other batmans, heck even the joker is ripped in suicide squad. The guy is 6ft exactly but his frame is tiny and it shows next to bigger actors. The story was God awful without spoiling pretty much lots of people die, bombs go off and some personal people Batman knows get injured. Then Batman goes welp I can't be in 3 places at once I'm only human. And proceeds to get ko'd twice throughout the movie and punched lots during fights. He is by far the worst and weakest looking Batman with the worst actor to have played him. The cinematography was good and the horror feeling this brings is good but everything else was just so horrible. Did I mention this film is 3 hours long to have a crap middle and end? Well know I know!. Wow I couldn't wait for thr 3 hours to end and multiple people walked out before the film was half finished. Definitely wouldn't reccomend this garbage piece of cinema. 2/10 for me.",

This was a very obvious \"woke\" fest. I like the diversity but it's when they blatantly shove rhetoric down your throat that it starts to become cringey.

      "text": "On Halloween, Gotham City mayor Don Mitchell Jr. is murdered by a serial killer calling himself the Riddler. Billionaire Bruce Wayne, who has operated for two years as the vigilante Batman, investigates alongside the Gotham City Police Department (GCPD). Lieutenant James Gordon discovers that the Riddler left a message for Batman, but commissioner Pete Savage berates him for allowing a vigilante to enter the crime scene and forces Batman to leave. The Riddler kills Savage and leaves another message for Batman.\n\nBatman and Gordon discover that the Riddler left a thumb drive in Mitchell's car containing images of Mitchell with a woman, Annika, at the Iceberg Lounge, a nightclub operated by mobster Carmine Falcone's lieutenant Penguin. Batman questions the Penguin, who pleads ignorance, but notices that Selina Kyle, Annika's roommate and girlfriend, works there as a waitress. After Annika disappears, Batman sends Selina back to the Iceberg Lounge to search for answers. Through Selina, Batman discovers that Savage was on Falcone's payroll, as is district attorney Gil Colson. Selina shuts off communication when Batman presses her about her relationship with Falcone.\n\nThe Riddler abducts Colson, straps a timed collar bomb to his neck, and sends him to interrupt Mitchell's funeral. When Batman arrives, the Riddler calls him via Colson's phone and threatens to detonate the bomb if Colson cannot answer three riddles. Batman helps Colson answer the first two, but Colson refuses to answer the third: name of the informant who gave the GCPD information that led to a historic drug bust ending mobster Sal Maroni's operation. The bomb explodes, killing Colson and knocking Batman unconscious.\n\nBatman and Gordon deduce that the informant may be the Penguin and track him to a drug deal. They discover that Maroni's operation never actually ended and many GCPD officers are involved. Selina inadvertently exposes them when she arrives to steal money. As the Penguin flees, Selina discovers Annika's corpse in a car trunk. Batman captures the Penguin but learns that he was not the informant.\n\nBatman and Gordon follow the Riddler's trail to the ruins of an orphanage operated by Bruce's parents Thomas and Martha. They learn that the Riddler was a resident at the orphanage and holds a grudge against the Wayne family. Bruce's butler and caretaker, Alfred Pennyworth, is hospitalized after opening a letter bomb addressed to Bruce. The Riddler then leaks evidence that Thomas, who was running for mayor when he was murdered, hired Falcone to kill a journalist for threatening to reveal embarrassing details about Martha's history of mental illness. Bruce, who grew up believing his father was morally upstanding, confronts Alfred, who confirms the allegations but states that Thomas decided to turn Falcone over to the police after learning of the murder; Alfred surmises that Falcone had Thomas and Martha killed to prevent this.\n\nSelina tells Batman that Falcone is her neglectful father. She learns that Annika was strangled because Mitchell told her that Falcone was the informant, and resolves to kill him. Batman and Gordon arrive at the Iceberg Lounge in time to stop her. Batman physically prevents Selina from killing Falcone, explaining that she shouldn't allow Falcone to destroy her future through murdering him and facing prison. Batman escorts a cocky Falcone to the police, while Falcone tells Batman that he knows of all Gotham's hidden secrets and underworld dealings and that everything he knows dies with him. No sooner does Batman bring Falcone outside to the patrol waiting than Riddler snipes Falcone from his apartment window. Unmasked as forensics accountant Edward Nashton, the Riddler is incarcerated in Arkham State Hospital. Nashton says that, as a neglected orphan, he was envious of the sympathy Bruce received after his parents' murder. He idolizes Batman-who inspired him to target the corrupt-and proposes a partnership, but Batman angrily rejects him.\n\nAngered at being rejected by his idol, Nashton begins ranting to which Batman realizes that Nashton still has something planned. Upon realizing Batman hasn't figured out his next course of action, a delighted Nashton gives him one last clue by singing \"Ave Maria,\" the song sung at the Mitchell's funeral to imply that the final part of the plan is mayor-elect Bella Real's assassination. However, Batman fails to realize this and exclaims, \"What have you done!?\"\n\nSearching his apartment, Batman is inadvertently aided by a cop who shows him a carpet cutting tool which Riddler had murdered the mayor with at the beginning. Realizing this tool is another clue to uncovering the Riddler's master plan, Batman cuts open the rug of the apartment and discovers via a map drawn on the floor underneath that Nashton has stationed car bombs around Gotham. No sooner has he done this than an online video of Nashton's final transmission before his capture and incarceration plays, explaining gleefully that he had cultivated an online following that plans to assassinate mayor-elect Bella Re√°l.\n\nThe bombs destroy the breakwaters around Gotham and flood the city. A shelter is set up in an indoor arena, where Nashton's followers non-fatally shoot Re√°l but are stopped by Batman and Selina. While battling the cult atop the rafters, Batman defeats them but is almost killed by a last member who is about to execute Batman. Selina arrives and rescues Batman before kissing him, thanking him for preventing her from murdering Falcone. However, the member comes to and almost kills Selina with a knife. Batman is incapacitated from his injuries and unable to get up to protect Selina. He injects himself with adrenaline, gets up, and tackles the member to the ground. He has the member pinned down and beats his face savagely until he is stopped by Gordon and Selina. Gordon approaches the member and tears off his mask to reveal his swollen, bruised face. Gordon asks, \"Who the hell are you?\". The man responds, \"Me? I'm vengeance.\"\n\nBatman sees a power line swinging just past the crowds in the flooded water below, throwing sparks everywhere as it flails wildly. Batman uses his grappling hook to swing toward the cord and grab onto it. Once he is hanging onto the cord, he uses his detachable bat emblem to sever it, causing him to be shocked by the electricity and fall down into the water. Batman rises from the water, lights a flare, and leads the survivors to safety. Batman aids recovery efforts and vows to inspire hope in Gotham, having seen that his weapon of fear has fueled the drive of vigilantes.\n\nMeanwhile in Arkham, Nashton is upset that his plan failed and wailing in his cell. A neighboring cell mate, who is largely obscured behind the steel door of his cell, proposes Nashton a riddle, asking, \"Riddle me this. The less you have of me, the more I am worth.\" Nashton answers, \"A friend.\" They laugh together.\n\nSelina deems Gotham to be beyond saving and tries to convince Batman to leave with her, but he declines. They set out to the streets on their motorcycles, playfully weaving around each other. When they get to a fork in the road, Selina goes right and Batman goes left. He looks back in his mirror as she disappears into the horizon. Then, he looks straight ahead."

        "reviewText": "It sickened me in the past to see the Batman movie franchise slowly digging it's way to an early grave. After the quality Tim Burton films, the series pretty much went down the toilet, beginning a horrifically campy age of 'Bat credit-cards' and an armored Arnold Schwarzenegger tossing cringe-worthy puns at a Batman who seemed to be trying not to be embarrassed by the fact that his costume had nipples. So what could Warner Brothers producers hope to do to resurrect the franchise? Pretend it never happened, and start the whole series over again with a talented director, compelling story and capable cast. \n\nEnter Christopher Nolan, the mastermind behind 2000's 'Momento', widely praised as one of the most innovative films of the decade. As director/co- screenwriter, Nolan creates a richly dark, atmospheric world for Batman to inhabit, similar to that of the Burton films, but less cartoony. The film's screenplay, written by Nolan and David S. Goyer is quality stuff, it's true that some of the dialog exchanges can seem kind of contrived, particularly between Wayne and Liam Neeson's character, Ducard, but it sounds so classy you tend not to care. \n\nNolan also puts a lot of trust in his audiences to stay put while the first hour of the film comprehensively explores Bruce Wayne's backstory, with no cape donning and few fight sequences. Nevertheless, the pace never slows, and the story is so unexpected and fascinating (who would have expected a Batman film to begin in a prison in Tibet? only Nolan could pull it off!) there's little chance of us losing interest. And this way, we really get a sense of who Bruce Wayne is, a trait none of the past movies were able to capture, including the Burton films. We see what drives him, what leads him to become this iconic crime fighter, and the reasoning behind the mask.\n\nOf course, to help the audience get under Bruce Wayne's skin, it doesn't hurt to have such a talented lead as Christian Bale. Bale has been emerging as one of the most talented actors of his generation, and he brings that talent to a peak here, playing the darkest of all superheroes. If you were to break down the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne, you would find that it is essentially three characters: Wayne as Batman, behind the mask; Wayne's public facade as the billionaire playboy; and the real, brooding Bruce Wayne. Bale plays all three of the characters to absolute perfection, and molds them together well enough to make it clear to show they are still the same person. He has been given tons of accolades for his performance already, and needless to say, he deserves every one.\n\nAnd the sheer quality of the supporting cast is mind-boggling, if for the number of big names only. It's very hard to find a weak spot in the incredibly strong array of performances here, but if one had to be found, it would have to be Katie Holmes. It's not that she gives a bad performance, on the contrary, but just she seems too young to be convincing as a district attorney. For me, Michael Gough will always be the definitive Alfred, but Michael Caine does an excellent job of taking over the role, giving a very strong (and often funny) performance. Liam Neeson is sheer class as Ducard, Wayne's mysterious mentor, as is Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, Wayne's arms manufacturer and provider of the Batman gear. It's wonderful to see the incredibly talented and much underrated Gary Oldman as Sgt. Gordon, the only decent cop in Gotham, and he truly makes the role his own. Even cult favorite Rutger Hauer makes an appearance as Richard Earle, the ambitious head of Wayne Enterprises. And (surprise surprise!) the villains are also actually menacing for once, as opposed to cartoony and corny. Cillian Murphy just about walks away with the show as the truly chilling Scarecrow (the sequences involving his 'fear gas' are surprisingly frightening) Ken Watanabe is mysterious and creepy as guild leader Ra's Al Ghul and Tom Wilkinson is very convincing as Carmine Falcone, head of the Gotham city mob. \n\nNolan's knack for realism also comes as a breath of fresh air in this age of CGI bloated blockbusters - there are next to no computer generated shots in the movie, even a sequence with Batman standing on top of a high building staring down at the city was filmed with a stuntman. And it really works, the Batmobile actually interacts with it's environment, and looks so much better real than computer generated. But don't think that the film will come across as too serious and stuffy because of Nolan's realism - true, Gotham seems too dark and dirty to come across as a fantasy world, but Batman Begins retains that unmistakable sense of fun that seems to only be present in comic book movies. We jeer and fear the villains, and cheer the hero as he lays his life on the line to vanquish evil and save the city. And that is how it should be. There's even a surprising twist near the end, which is doubly surprising because it actually comes as a shock. What's not to love here?\n\n(and, further cudos to director Nolan for finally managing to make a swarm of bats actually frightening for once)\n\nOverall, I'd have to label Batman Begins 'The must see movie of the summer' - it's a well written, authoritatively directed, impeccably acted (especially by Bale's powerhouse lead performance and Cillian Murphy's sickly menacing Scarecrow) and very high quality production. Indeed, most other summer blockbusters could learn a thing or two from Batman Begins. If the Batman franchise died under it's own gaudiness years ago, let us rejoice this glorious rebirth - Batman truly does begin here.\n\n-10/10",

        "reviewText": "British director Christopher Nolan is better known for his lower-profile thrillers such as the excellent MEMENTO and the brilliant INSOMNIA, but his first big-budget Hollywood blockbuster is still in the same league as the other two: a tremendously inventive and exciting piece of filmmaking, which breathes a whole new life into the Batman saga and proves to be the best film of the series (shame it took till number five to get it right, but that's life). Nolan dispenses with any previous cast or story lines, instead taking Batman back to his roots, and the result is a tough, violent, realistic adventure which isn't marred by any of the comic-book campness or flights of fancy which spoiled the others. Batman is just an ordinary guy here, without any superpowers, but instead his Bond-style gadgets allow him to become the caped crusader by night.\n\nThe casting is extraordinary and the ensemble all give outstanding performances. Bale is terrific, finally getting some of the acclaim he deserves; I've been watching this guy for a few years now and he's been great in everything I've seen. Caine is cast as Alfred the butler, and supplies genuinely warm comedy and wit. Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman are friendly allies, although their roles are relatively minor. Katie Holmes is the attractive love interest and she, too, is surprisingly good. However, it's the villains which have the best parts; Liam Neeson has his best role in many years and is fantastic in it, whilst THE LAST SAMURAI's Ken Watanabe is creepy as a cult leader. Cillian Murphy (28 DAYS LATER) is truly memorable as weirdo bad guy The Scarecrow, whilst Tom Wilkinson is almost unrecognisable as a hardline gangster. Even Rutger Hauer is in it, and that's gotta be good, seeing as he's been stuck in DTV movie hell for a decade.\n\nThe film is long ‚Äì 2 ¬Ω hours to be precise ‚Äì but the suspense and action keep it moving. There are car chases, fist fights, massive battles and lots of other stuff going on. The plot keeps you guessing all the way through and there are plenty of surprising twists. My only complaint is that the action is cut too fast, and too close, so that it's pretty hard to see what's happening, but the excellent soundtrack helps make up for that. Still, a minor complaint with what is otherwise a flawless film ‚Äì let's hope they all team up to make some more classics like this.",

        "reviewText": "Christopher Nolan (and cast) have pulled off what I hadn't dared to dream - a Batman every bit as good as Burton/Keaton's vision - and eradicated the camp, feverish memories of Clooney, Kilmer and (cough..) O'Donnell.\n\nThe story is as good an origin story as you'll find - covering all the major (true-to-the-comic) events, and not wasting ages on them. We see Wayne's all-important training period (previously ignored), and his connection to the Tibetan shadow-ninja clan led by Ra's Al Ghul. We see Bruce come up with ideas for his symbol, his costume, his gadgets, his car, his cave - IT ALL FITS SO PERFECTLY.\n\nThat's not all - Liam Neeson is perfect (as ever, when Lucas isn't writing his lines), Batman's first mad nemesis (the Scarecrow) is genuinely frightening; with some outstandingly scary 'fear' effects.. Gary Oldman looks just like a young Commissioner Gordon (and doesn't dominate), Morgan Freeman and Rutger Hauer give solid heavyweight support to the boardroom machinations at Wayne Enterprizes. I love Michael Gough(?) but Michael Caine is great as Alfred. It's only Katie Holmes who didn't ring true for me - not because of her performance, but simply because she looks all of 15 years old (sorry Katie). I am always blown away by Christian Bale, and this is no exception.\n\nThe fights are great, the Bat-gadgets all there, the car is amazing, the plot is thorough and exciting, Gotham looks great, Batman really is frightening & menacing (and lethal!).. And the scenes with the bats themselves FINALLY get across the idea of how scary they can be.\n\nThere is some humour, but it's fairly dry. The soundtrack, like all the best original soundtracks, is excellent - you hardly know it's there, but the emotions of the scene are enhanced and boosted. For the most part this is a serious Batman film, with plenty for long-time fans. This NEW Batman is one I'd like to see again. Bravo Mr Nolan, bravo.",

        "reviewText": "Batman Begins was a massive breath of fresh air when it came out in 2005. Coming 8 years after Warner Brothers jumped the bat, as it were, with Joel Schumacher's childish mess, \"Batman and Robin\", Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins brought a maturity and seriousness to The Caped Crusader that had been absent since Tim Burton left the world of Gotham. While Batman Begins might not boast the visual prowess or rich villains of Burton's two Batman movies, it fleshed out the character of Bruce Wayne in a way no movie has since.\n\nBatman Begins is an origin story straight through, detailing Bruce Wayne's (Christian Bale) emergence from tragically scarred child to a symbol of heroism and darkness. After training with Ra's al Ghul and the League of Shadows, Bruce Wayne returns to Gotham in perfect mental and physical shape. What Nolan and screenwriter David Goyer do perfectly here, is inject Bruce Wayne with an emotion never before seen in a Batman movie. You can feel the pain and grief Wayne is experiencing and you can see why he decides to become a living symbol of good. \n\nThe first full origin story for Batman on film, Batman Begins is very much told from Bruce's point of view. Earlier Batman movies often focused more heavily on developing the villains, leaving Bruce Wayne in the shadows. The approach that keeps Batman a dark, mysterious figure is a valiant one, and it makes sense. However, context rarely hurts, and Batman Begins provides the character with heaps of context. You can clearly understand the emotions and motivations of the man behind the mask. The origin is also utterly believable. You can see why Bruce Wayne dresses like a bat, why he needs a cape, how he gets a super-car and super-gadgets, and why he hides in a cave. Does it strip Batman of his mythic status? Yes, a bit. Luckily, unlike Nolan's two follow-ups, Begins doesn't get too carried away with realism, retaining a comic book style that its successor would forget.\n\nWhile it does take a while for Bruce Wayne to fully become the bat, it is worth it. Once Bruce Wayne finally dons the cape and cowl, there are a few jaw-dropping action scenes including a brilliant batmobile chase scene and a thrilling climax on Gotham's elevated trains. The atmosphere and feeling of Gotham City is nearly perfect in it's own way. It does not have the Gothic beauty of Tim Burton's Batman universe, but it's blend of comic book dinginess and contemporary sleekness makes Gotham a terrifically realized cityscape. The city feels like what a comic book world would be like if it actually existed. Batman himself is a dark, brooding, wonderfully realized character in his own right and he shares the screen with an ensemble of great actors. Michael Caine as Alfred, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, and Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon are standouts in an ensemble cast that is playing the comic book material straight as an arrow. Cillian Murphy as the Scarecrow is an excellent but criminally underused baddie, but on the whole, the supporting cast elevates the material.\n\nBatman Begins is still as fresh today as it was more than a decade ago. The origin of Batman is engaging, engrossing, and emotional. The story provides a context to the Bruce Wayne character that elevates the movie beyond its fun comic book plot. The origin is a satisfying and believable one, and once Batman finally enters the scene, the action is unmatched. Batman Begins is a strong, confident summer superhero blockbuster with more maturity and emotional truth than most dramas. I hesitate to call it the definitive interpretation of Batman (Batman 1989 takes that title), but Batman Begins is the best of Christopher Nolan's Batman movies, a film that balances gritty realism, human drama, and thrilling comic book fun.\n\n85/100",

        "reviewText": "From PASTO, COLOMBIA-Via: L. A. CA; CALI, COLOMBIA+ORLANDO, FL\n\n-----------The ONLY Tony Kiss Castillo on FaceBook!----------------------\n\nWarner Brothers gave us a very special gift for Father's Day, 2005... BATMAN BEGINS. Despite displaying some lethargy in its opening scenes, and suffering from some of the excesses so common in this genre of film, not only might you say it is the best of the Batman Franchise, so far, but also that it is definitely the best super-hero film ever!\n\nDirector, Christopher Nolan, who dazzled with his amazing talent in the 2000 Cult Classic, MEMENTO, has assembled a formidable cast (Michael Caine, Liam Neesom, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson & Morgan Freeman, among others), an outstanding script and special effects all well focused in a film that transforms a two dimensional comic strip into a work of real depth!\n\nIn the title role, we have Christian Bale, British, 31 at the time the film was made, someone who has spent most of his life in front of the cameras, without reaching, at least at this juncture in time, the long-awaited status of \"Super-Star\". In 2000, Bale took on another title role in American Psycho, a 'Cult Classic' which received ample attention from both critics and audiences alike. (If you have not seen this psychological thriller, do soWhat a gem it is! Bale is chillingly creepy!)\n\nOn the one hand, Mr. Bale is one of very few British actors (Well, Welsh, to be exact) capable of playing an American where his accent, intonation, and even body language, is absolutely perfect, impeccable! (After taking in American Psycho, I could have sworn he was American!) However, in BEGINS, although his performance seemed quite good, it was slightly below my expectation. I attribute this to two factors. First, as I'm sure Bale was already awareaudiences went in with tremendously high expectations regarding his role. And secondly, with a supporting cast of the caliber involved in this film, it would have been almost impossible to stand out in the same way he did in American Psycho. .\n\nFor my taste, the only really weak link was the now famous for being Tom Cruise's-EX, Katie Holmes! Before appearing in BEGINS, Ms. Holmes never had a real stand-out role, at least in my opinion, nor really had been in many high profile films. To all fairness to her, though, it wasn't so much that her characterization was extremely lacking as much as that her performance just wasn't up to those of others in this brilliant cast! .\n\nTo highlight the very best that Batman Begins shows us, unlike almost all movies in this genre, its characters are anything BUT black and white. Just as in real life, almost all of them evolve in a kind of constant metamorphosis, responding and interacting with lady luck, day to day life events, and reactions from those around them! And they do it most convincingly, not the least bit far-fetched. .\n\nBefore rushing out to see it, just a little warning. For those who yearn for Action-packed blockbusters, Begins might leave you feeling somewhat unfulfilled! And for those who crave really intense human drama, since, at the end of the day, this is still a comic book \"super-hero\", not some conflicted politician, or not even anything closeLet's try to keep things in perspective, O. K.? In conclusion, if you have EVER seen any film based on a comic strip that you have liked in the past, then don't hesitate to see Batman Begins...I guarantee you'll be rating it at least 7 STARS!\n\n10********** SuperHero *Stars*...ENJOY! / DISFRUTELA!\n\nAny comments, questions or observations, in English o en Espa√±ol, are most welcome!......",

        "reviewText": "I had fearful reservations about this one. I loved Tim Burton's Batman - 12 years old when it came out I was the perfect age for it and I also enjoyed Batman Returns. The franchise went so wrong under Joel Schumacher that I wasn't sure I wanted it resurrected. Not least because Batman was one of the few comics I read and enjoyed as a kid and was always my favourite superhero. I grew up reading the comics, watching reruns of the Adam West TV show and then getting Burton's celluloid vision. I was spoilt for choice as a kid but as an adult now I was concerned revisiting the franchise, especially given Warner's record over the last decade of screwing up summer blockbusters with potential all over the place (dare I bring up the Matrix sequels?)\n\nHowever, I am pleased to report I could not have been more wrong about how great Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins is. This is better than Burton. Sacrilege, you say?! Well Burton was still cartoony in many elements, he wasn't churning out the bilge of Schumacher but Burton's Batman was still over the top. As a kid this was ideal but Nolan's Batman is real. Everything in this world seems plausible and it is therefore a world that draws you in. Characters' vulnerability is that much more present. Every bruise, every scare, every concern, every emotion seems real.\n\nPart of this is that Nolan has assembled an exemplary cast. Again, this concerned me prior to seeing the film. I wasn't sure a cast of big name legends like Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman and well known names like Liam Neeson and Katie Holmes wouldn't detract and distract from Batman. I was always sure Christian Bale could be the great moody Batman he's been waiting his career to be but the others I wasn't so sure about.\n\nThat said Bale is not just good, he's superb. I never thought I'd really be able to envision anyone other than Michael Keaton as the definitive Batman for me but since seeing Batman Begins a couple of days ago Bale has cemented himself in the position. Perhaps Keaton will now be able to escape the spectre of Batman he hasn't truly shaken off for 13 years.\n\nThe rest of the cast is also pitch perfect. Cillian Murphy is creepy as hell, Liam Neeson is authoritative and imposing, Katie Holmes is strong and sexy (I particularly thought she'd be insipid, she should jettison Tom Cruise and let her talent - which she does have naysayers just watch Pieces Of April - speak for itself) and Michael Caine is an Alfred you've never seen but in fact far more likely as a butler than the aristocratic pomp with which he is usually portrayed. Gary Oldman is also superb in a rare wholly decent character for him as Lieutenant Jim Gordon who gets far more to so here than Gordon has ever had to do before. Only Tom Wilkinson is a little off with a slightly comedic wise-guy American accent that never really convinces.\n\nThe emotional bond between Bruce Wayne and Alfred is actually a wonderful human heart to the film than Nolan and Goyer have written perfectly.\n\nDon't let that make you think the action is not front and centre though. From Wayne's training through the early stages of the film to his early missions as Batman at about the half way point to a thrillingly choreographed chase sequence and an edge of your seat finale this film delivers the cool quotient in bucket loads.\n\nGreat villains (especially Murphy), great story, great cast, great action... put simply, great film. Probably the best comic-book movie ever made (that's excluding the genius Sin City which I consider a moving comic-book rather than a comic-book movie, that will never be bettered but Batman is a different beast and the best of its kind).",

        "reviewText": "BATMAN BEGINS lives up to what I heard about it being a \"darker\" version, with much less reliance on flippant one-liners or gags, the result being a more realistic feel for what might have been.\n\nFrom the very start, there is a nice chemistry between Alfred, the butler (superbly played by Michael Caine) and Bruce Wayne (excellent job by Christian Bale). The humor is of the gentle kind, almost subtle in its implications, and it sets the stage for the more realistic flow of events to follow. There's a pulsating background score by Hans Zimmer and John Newton Howard that races along with the film, punctuating it in just the right places, at just the right moments, to give a vigorous punch to the action scenes. And there are plenty of them.\n\nBut the quieter moments are all extremely well played and given depth by real characterizations--not just cartoonish figures. There is depth in all of the performances with the possible exception of Katie Holmes, an actress who speaks in a voice barely above a whisper and fails to project the belief that she is an assistant district attorney. Miss Holmes needs lessons in projecting her voice.\n\nLooming over the landscape is Liam Neeson, a distinguished actor who excels in his carefully concealed villainy. He is a force to be reckoned with and displays all of his versatility here. Equally effective in lesser roles are Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer as the Board Chairman that Bruce Wayne ultimately replaces, and Gary Oldman.\n\nThe story is forcefully presented with magnificent visuals and eye-popping sets that all have a realistic gleam and are yet stylized enough to give credence to the fact that this is all based on a comic strip character.\n\nI can't praise Christian Bale enough as the man who dons that mask. He has all the strength and wily intelligence behind his serious good looks and makes the perfect embodiment of the action hero he is portraying. Firm of jaw, direct of gaze, he makes an excellent hero.\n\nPraise too for Cillian Murphy, who makes the most of his Scarecrow role behind a mask of creepy blandness, underplaying his role (as most of the others do) so as not to become a caricature, as so often happens in these Batman enterprises. If it's a series of running gags that you expect--as from previous Batmans--you won't find them here. The thrills come one after another, set pieces that are astounding to watch.\n\nWell worth the wait. Christopher Nolan has done an excellent job of handling his subject matter with great skill and flourish. \n\nWarning note: Perhaps a little too intense for children, but adults are certainly going to appreciate the fact that the real Batman has arrived.",

Then I saw the preview to Batman Begins, I didn't really know what to think. New Batman. New Alfred. New story. New style. I wasn't sure why I wanted it 'the old way', but maybe I wanted to the actors in the Batman films I grew up with, to revive themselves and make a good Batman movie. I wanted Robin and sadly, Batgirl, alongside Batman saving the world from another familiar villain.\n\nI heard Batman Begins, and I thought great, this was called \"Batman\" in 1989, selfishly I said, \"I want something new!\".\n\nBut, of course being a big Batman fan, I went opening night to Begings. 2 and half hours later, like the rest of the audience was completely blown away. It was the only movie I had ever been to (and yes I have been to some great ones) where the crowd claps and the end. This was not just golf claps for a popcorn clip, this was a standing ovation for 10:30 pm show in a crowded theater in Austin, Texas.\n\nI never would have thought this would have worked, even with Nolan directing. But I was wrong, so wrong. After seeing the X-Mens and Spidermans, I clearly thought Marvel had the upperhand and DC was just simply trying to keep up, again, so wrong.\n\nNolan gave us a dark, gritty, and pleasantly realistic, view of Batman. Bale gives a tremendous performance as both Batman and Bruce Wayne. Michael Caine was a fabulous Alfred, and Morgan Freeman almost stole the show as Luscious Fox.\n\nEven though X-Men and Spiderman(all of them) are wonderful superhero movies, Batman Begins, is just a good, no, great movie. And I think that is what blew people away, that it wasn't just some superhero, special effect, hero gets girl, good guy wins movie, it was a truly dark and well crafted movie, and it maybe stupid to say, but it didn't even feel like you were watching a superhero movie.\n\nI don't even think Burton, and his animated style(which works), could have revived this troubled series, that Schumaker wrecked, because like Fantastic Four and Daredevil, tried over do it and give us the latter part of things.\n\nSo, here is to you Chris Nolan. You saved a franchise. You made an unforgettable movie, that will be remembered as the best superhero movie of all time, but just an all around great and unforgettable movie classic.",

It's a big character, and not just another girlfriend.\n\nThe second is that Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy) isn't a big enough villain. The evil plan has too much of a silly Bond feeling.

It goes into great detail to explain to us how Batman came to be. It has verisimilitude. The bad guys are, of course, really exaggerated in their evil plans. Everything is neatly plotted. There is fragility in both the character of Wayne and the city he and his family loved. Organized crime abounds and he must face it pretty much alone. I was quite impressed with Inspector Gordon (Gary Oldmann). He was believable and fragile, yet committed to what was right amidst a culture of evil (even on the police force). Like is so often the case, I can't speak for the people who know these comics so well that they fall into depression when a movie doesn't follow their dictates; yet, I really was involved in this.

It goes into great detail about subjects such as how he got his costume, what exactly it is. Same goes with the Batmobile. We also find out why he chose to be bat-like.\n\nOne of the more interesting aspects here is how it shows Bruce's father, Thomas Wayne (Linus Roache), and how he molded Bruce's life and instilled good judgment within him, a point which is misunderstood about him by most people he comes in contact with. Thomas, too, teaches Bruce valuable lesson, such as \"We fall so we can learn to pick ourselves up\". This is pretty close to the theme of the movie or motto Bruce Wayne lives by. The resemblance of the father & son is pretty good, too.\n\nI also thoroughly enjoyed the training Bruce Wayne endured becoming \"invincible\". Bruce is trained by Ducard (Liam Neeson) in many ways like a ninja (The concept of Batman IS similar to a ninja). He is taught many valuable lessons in this temple and is shown no mercy. Eventually, we even see his first real enemy as a superhero/vigilante.\n\nAlthough I am not positive as to how true to the comic book this movie is, I am sure it took a few liberties, as did Spider-Man. Most of the small examples I have noticed are for the better and make for a good story. The Batmobile is more believable as an expensive armored vehicle that the military would not spend the money on than a juiced up Corvette (or whatever that was). Same with the Batsuit.\n\nKatie Holmes is excellent as Rachel Dawes, a D.A. who is not afraid to go after the big villains in court. Also worthy of mentioning is Michael Caine as Alfred the butler. I do not believe they could have found a better man for that role, although I could not get the image of Caine as Austin Powers' dad out of my head when he was on screen.\n\nFinally, in my opinion, Christian Bale makes a much better Batman than the three recent previous ones in Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer and George Clooney. Something about him makes Batman darker and more mysterious. Hopefully, DC Comics and movies have learned from their mistakes and we will not have to worry about Batman picking up a sidekick in this newest installment of the Batman series. 9/10",

Nolan's use of realism in the creating the Batman character makes him more believable than ever.\n\nChristian Bale quite simply personified the character of Bruce Wayne/Batman and actually puts everyone else's portrayal in the shadows. Bale is supported by a wonderful cast, including Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and more, but i found Cillian Murphy's performance as Dr. Jonathon Crane to be one of the finest in the movie.\n\nOverall Batman begins is an very honest, detailed and compelling adaptation of the Batman character, that is worthy of the recognition it has received. For Bat fans and movie lovers alike; this is a must see.\n\n9/10",

        "reviewText": "My only criticism of this otherwise brilliant movie is that it is a little too long. But it is an extremely good film, that along with the original Batman could very well be the best of the Batman films(thought perhaps just lacking the original film's sophistication). People may find this blasphemy, but I did prefer this over The Dark Knight, but that was still very good. Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins is stylish, dark and gritty, pretty much what Batman should be. I have seen complaints that the film \"contradicts\" the 1989 film. Perhaps so, but what I can say in the film's defence is that Batman Begins is sort of a very loose prequel to the original movies.\n\nVisually, Batman Begins looks absolutely incredible! It could very well be the most beautiful visually of the Batman films, with beautiful cinematography and a simply dazzling view of Gotham City itself. Another asset I appreciated was that the music score didn't overpower the action, in fact it gave some atmospheric flavour to it. As much as Danny Elfman's scores were outstanding and definitely memorable, Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard do a great job with the score.\n\nThe script is taut and well-written with lines that really make you think along with some occasional offbeat humour, the plot isn't convoluted or predictable but original, the film moves briskly(the second half was marginally better in terms of pacing to the first half though but that is in no way a flaw) and the action is explosive particularly the climax and the bat-mobile car-chase. Also Christopher Nolan's direction is excellent.\n\nThe acting, aside from the visuals is what drives the film. Christian Bale is for me the best Batman since Michael Keaton. In the role of Batman he is suitably dark and brooding, like Batman should be, and as Bruce Wayne, he is dashing, handsome and ambitious. Katie Holmes actually surprised me and in a good way. She wasn't bland or annoying, I actually found her sympathetic and surprisingly good. Liam Neeson is also very good, though he has been better, while Michael Caine is perfect as Alfred. Cillian Murphy, Tom Wilkinson and the excellent, underrated Gary Oldman are also solid in their roles, while Morgan Freeman is wonderful as always.\n\nOverall, a brilliant film that is visually stunning, gripping and atmospheric. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox",

But after a while, I loved the film. In fact, it turned out to be my favourite Batman movie even though I really like the first two Batman movies by Tim Burton. \n\nI really like how we get to see the origins of Batman like the tragic death of his parents and becoming a martial arts expert in somewhere in Asia. Also I think it's clever how they made Batman act like a ninja than a superhero. Christian Bale is really good and intimidating as Batman but I think he's not as good as Michael Keaton's Batman. But also I think the rest of the cast did very well like Katie Holmes, Liam Neeson, Michael Caine and Cillian Murphy. But I can't understand why Katie Holmes was nominated for a Razzie for Worst Supporting Actress. I liked her as Rachel and she was a lot better than Maggie Gyllenhaal; not to mention better-looking. \n\nIt's too bad The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises weren't as great as Batman Begins. I mean I think The Dark Knight is really overrated. I mean most people seem to be overglorifying it just because of Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker and his death. But The Dark Knight Rises was brilliant and gave a nice ending to the trilogy but I don't think it wasn't as fresh as Batman Begins.

This movie is probably the best of all the \"Batman\" movies to ever be released. Christopher Nolan reinvents this iconic character in the most humane way we have ever seen the character in before. It's also the greatest way we have ever seen. Christian Bale is a very good Batman, but I don't believe in his judgment all the time, taking a scene where he is about to kill a man, but fails when the same man is killed by another assassin. I didn't really get his full emotion in that scene, but he is still very good. Liam Neeson is the best villain for Batman to take on as he inhabits the iconic villain Ra's al Ghul who we all know from the comicbooks. This is a great movie that I can't help but love even more every single time I watch the movie.",

        "reviewText": "Batman Begins (2005) is actually great reboot of The Dark Knight trilogy and a start of the origin tale of Batman, but is not the best one in the series, that will be The Dark Knight (2008). Batman Begins is strayed from the comic books. My DC comic super hero on a 1st rank will always be Batman I always love Batman from comic books, cartoons and movies more than other superheroes. The first time I saw this movie, I didn't like it because I thought, it was boring and I didn't got the story. I grew up with Batman (1989) Michael Keaton and I did too loved much more than this one. But than I kept watching and watching it and I fall in love it, It always entertained me. In my opinion Christopher Nolan's and Burton's Batman are all great movies. \n\nIf it weren't for its amazing sequel this would be the greatest superhero film ever made. The film that started it all... a Batman film but with a more realistic, gritty and original approach. If your a fan of Batman and you haven't seen this you are going to LOVE every minute. It is smart, innovative, awe-inspiring and for a bat-fan, iconic. Christopher Nolan focuses on the origin and story behind a man standing against justice rather than the quirky early attempts. Its just a shame that this isn't as popular as The Dark Knight because it deserves the glory just as much. If your new and you've only just seen TDK, watch this purely because it catapulted this reinvention of a hero to great heights. TDK has the rise of The Clown Prince Of Crime and the escallation that was inevitable. Batman Begins has the creation of Batman and the lengths of which he had to go in order to combat injustice in a city that did not know justice. Watch this, it is a classic. \n\nWhat I like in Batman Begins is the origin story. I like that the movie focus on a comic book movie sadly Burton Batman doesn't follow on Batman origin story but follows more Joker story and I didn't pay for this movie to see Katie Holmes but naked and to be laid I am glad he didn't do that don't get me wrong but I don't like action hero's that always, always get a girl at the end of the movie and get laid I hate that! I am glad this was the beginning of Batman and the film took a different turn. Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) did not get laid or get the girl once. I love this movie and I am true Batman fan I always was more Batman fan than a Superman fan. Bruce Wayne being trained and been ninja the long path how he become Batman the fighting the suit the climbing the wall. Car chases, action sequences are awesome! \n\nThe actors: Christian Bale is an excellent darker Batman. He acted perfectly his role as Bruce and Batman the same time. I love Liam Neeson I think that actor did a wonderful convincing performance as Ducard/Ra's Al Ghul. He deserve a credit for his role that this movie redeem it self. Liam Neeson was terrific awesome convincing actor. This role was one of the reason why I become Liam Neeson fan and I enjoy his new action thrillers: Taken, Walk Among the Tombstones , Non-Stop, Taken 2 and Unknown. Rutger Hauer was awesome did you know he had a small role in comic book series Smallville? He was in Season 3 Episode 1 & 2. Cillian Murphy was great as Scarecrow! I love him and Tom Wilkinson was awesome too! Gary Oldman was amazing as Jim Gordon.\n\nThings I don't like in this movie: \n\nBatman Begins was really slow, the first hour of the movie was boring and really dramatic. The fighting sequence in this movie were shot to close with camera so we barely see a any fights between Batman and Ra's Al Ghul. Bruce Wayne blamed him self for his parents death. It wasn't his fault! The murder of his parents was too much dramatic too much for my eyes and Katie Holmes sadly I don't like her in this movie I would replace her with Maggie Gyllenhall or any other actress. I thought Maggie portrayed Rachel Dawes much better and made a better job in the sequel than Katie Holmes did. The fight between Batman and Ras' Al Ghul on a train I don't like it. Because the fight scene is too close, you can barely see who hit's who. That is the thing, that bothers me the most in this movie. The fight scenes in Burton's Batman are so much better, awesome than in Christopher Nolan's Batman and he could have made the fights scenes believable like Burton did. Peace <3./: I love this movie and it is a 9 by me. \n\nBatman Begins is a 2005 epic superhero film based on the fictional DC Comics character Batman, co-written and directed by Christopher Nolan\n\n9/10 Score: A- Studio: Warner Bros, Legendary Pictures, DC Comics Starring: Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer, Ken Watanabe, Morgan Freeman Director: Christopher Nolan Producers: Charles Roven, Emma Thomas, Larry Franco Screenplay: Christopher Nolan, David S.

        "reviewText": "And so the story begins. Well, according to 'Batman Begins' anyway. This is a very long film, but if offers a detailed account of Bruce Wayne's life, and for the first time in the franchise we really get to know the character. We know where he comes from, what motivates him, and understand why he becomes Batman. Bruce becoming Batman is shown in detail, and I enjoyed that.\n\nDespite being fantasy, the clever storytelling makes it feel realistic. I liked the idea that Bruce failed on numerous accounts. This showed that - behind the mask and cape - he was still just human, and not an actual superhero with powers. He is vulnerable, he hurts, he falls, and picks himself up again. None of the other Batman films so effectively illustrated the character as a human being. Bruce overcoming his fear is also well done.\n\n'Batman Begins' is visually stunning, with a great production design, and incredible action sequences. As with all the other Batman movies, there are more than one antagonist. The first antagonist is crime lord Falcone (Tom Wilkinson). He is then dethroned by antagonist Crane (Cillian Murphy), who - in my opinion - is the film's main antagonist. Then we also have Ducard (Liam Neeson), and even Earle (Rutger Hauer) turns out to be a villain. Too many antagonists for one film? Surprisingly, here, it works well.\n\nBatman must stop Crane, who dumps toxins into Gotham City's water supply, and Ducard, who wants to destroy Gotham City. The result is an action-packed thriller that delivers! The film also features a great score by Hans Zimmer.",

I appreciated it because they didn't overdo the violence, didn''t have a stupid romance angle to muddy up the real story, and fount it an interesting history of how Batman became Batman. \n\nThe first hour of this \"prequel\" dealt with his origins. If you're a fan of the comic book stories and the other Batman films, this part in the film should not bore you. It was like a documentary to me, about a topic I was interested in. In fact, on the second viewing I enjoyed this even more.\n\nChristian Bale did a fine job as the latest Batman. It's too bad there have been so many actors playing this role, ruining the continuity of this latest series. I hope Bale continues with a few more efforts with this character.\n\nIt was nice to see Michael Caine in the role of \"Alfred.\" He was excellent and the stabilizing force of the story. Katie Holmes did not have anywhere near as big a role, or romantic one, as I expected, and that was fine with me. I just enjoyed looking at her face, leaving it go at that. Gary Oldman was also interesting as a low-key young detective Gordon who would go on to become Commissioner Gordon in all the other episodes (but, once again, played by another actor.)\n\nThe film ends with what would be the beginning of the first Batman, featuring \"The Joker.\"\n\nAfter having seen all the Batman films several times, I now think is the best of them all....perhaps an unpopular choice, but that's my opinion. Don't let the naysayers keep you from watching this movie. You might be missing the best of the Batmans!",

        "reviewText": "To start off this review I'd like to go back to the original batman series. Adam West hammed it up in what has to be the campest yet enjoyable version of batman. It was cheesy, it had the POW, WHACK, KABOOM, very very tongue-in-cheek which, brings me to my next point, is what batman eventually became. Batman, featuring Michael Keaton was a good film, keaton was a good batman, he portrayed the dark knight to a whole new army of fans, a darker batman, less camp, plus with a villain such as Jack Nicholson (turning in another great performance) as the Joker it was win win. Where from there? A sequel, Keaton yet again, Batman Returns, not as good as its predecessor but still a thoroughly enjoyable film with the villains being Penguin (Devito) and Catwoman (Pfeiffer) adding something different to the batman series. All is going well, then things start to go sour. Keaton is gone and in comes Kilmer who has to be the most wooden Batman ever, in come the clich√©s, the tongue in cheek one-liners and so on but Batman still has some credibility until, dare I mention it, Batman & Robin. This ruined the Batman series with Clooney just being the eye-candy for the ladies, the addition of Batgirl (oh dear Lord) and the villains just coming out with the most tongue-in-cheek one liners ever, example Mr Freeze \"You're not sending me to the cooler\", wrong, oh so wrong. Something had to be done and this was Batman Begins. This film rescues the Batman series single-handedly, it's a shame it didn't start off this way as it might not of died on it's rear. Bale is an inspired choice as Batman bringing a more serious side to Batman, the story is well paced, it's not all talk or just mind-numbing action, it actually keeps you gripped as you want to find more about Bruce Wayne's past. The only reason it misses out on a 10 is the quite pitiful bad guy scarecrow If you've not seen it I don't want to give too much away about the story but throw away all your perceptions about Batman because Batman is back and Batman has truly begun.

Everything wrong with the previous four films is corrected here and since this movie got everything right I can now forget the first four films and just hope future sequels contain the same level of darkness, character and story development. What I enjoyed most about this film was that the characters were so well written and the Bruce Wayne character was given just as much strength as his Batman ego. I wasn't sure what to expect from Christian Bale but I'm glad the director kept his darkness and didn't try to lighten him up as an actor. The supporting players were also very well acted with a cast to die for. Liam Neeson, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are serious actors and they helped bring some seriousness to this comic book tale. It was also great seeing Gary Oldman playing a good guy. I always love rooting for his villains so rooting for him as a good guy just added more charm to the film.

I must say that before seeing the film, I felt in my heart this is the 'Batman' film we've been waiting for. Within ten minutes into the movie, I turned to my date and said to her, \"This is it! This is the movie!\" I just can't believe that after all these years, Warner Bros. finally got it right. For me the most intriguing part of the film, apart from the great script, and great acting, was Christopher Nolan's decision to base the film in reality. Deciding that Batman could really exist in our universe and our world was a stroke of genius. Another aspect of the film that's so refreshing is that instead of the focus being on the villain, Batman is the film's star. And rightly so. It's amazing what can happen when a studio leaves a respected director, and the creative team alone, and allow them to make the best movie possible. The only two negatives that I can think of is Katie Holmes and the fight sequences. Holmes does indeed look like a teenager playing grown-up. Her performance isn't bad per SE, it's just that you really don't buy her as an Assistant D.A. As for the fight sequences, I felt the cameras angles were too tight on the action, edited too quickly, and lit too dark so that you really couldn't tell what was going on and determine who was hitting who. Maybe we can attribute this to the fact that Nolan is not an action director. Hopefully the next film will open up the fight sequences so we can actually see Batman use the martial arts skills he developed during his exile. But apart from those relatively minor quibbles, the film is excellent, and I'm definitely going back on opening day June 15th, and seeing it a second time. A third and fourth viewing is definitely not out of the question.",

It is rare to see such intricate storytelling mixed with bone-shattering intensity in the action department.

This was because the director Chris Nolan is known for making psychological thrillers, and he also only used CGI when needed, he made the film using stunts and keeping the action down to earth.\n\nThe film focuses on Bruce Wayne becoming Batman and looks at the psychology of the man. It showed his personal angst and fears and how he used it to fight crime. The starts with a flashback of Bruce and his friend Rachel Dawes as children before seeing Bruce in a Chinese prison, aiming to understand the mind of criminals. Fear was a major theme. Bruce Wayne as Batman wanted to cause fear within criminals in Gotham, whilst the Scarecrow used fear as a weapon. Bruce's relationships are also looked at. In the film he is emotionally stunted because of the murder of his parents. It shows that he has few friends, Alfred, he was a father figure to him, Lucius Fox, who helps Bruce become Batman, Sgt. Gordon who is one of the few good cops in Gotham and Rachel, Bruce's love interest.\n\nAs well as showing Bruce/Batman as a more realistic human, Nolan takes great care to show how it was possible for someone to become Batman. The equipment used in the film is down to earth and not out the realms of possibility and the Batmobile looks like a real vehicle. I hated the 1960s programme of Batman, I really disliked the camp in it and I hated the silliness. I didn't like Batman Forever or Batman and Robin (that one was laughably bad). The Tim Burton version was better, but I still felt like a cartoon. However Batman Returns is a good film in it's own right. I liked that fact that Gotham looked like a city, namely because it was filmed in Chicago, but I felt it was just right for the film.\n\nThe film also had an excellent case, and I personally enjoyed the British/Irish favour to it. Christian Bale was brilliant as Batman, Michael Caine was good as Alfred. Gary Oldman, an actor I've always liked played Gordon who grows as a character in the film. Tom Wilkinson, Liam Neeson and Cillian Murphy were good as the villains. Morgan Freeman, one of the felt Americans to have a major part was also had a fine performance as Fox. The only person I had a problem with was Katie Holmes, but it was only because I thought she was too young to be playing a Deputy DA, not because she was a bad actress. I think Maggie Gyllenhaal should be more suited for the role in the next film.\n\nThe film also has the feeling of it being like Batman: Year One by Frank Miller. It is not a carbon copy of the Graphic Novel, but it is very similar and the ending is lifted from the Graphic Novel. Year One also set out to show Batman's origins and show how it could have been possible. Batman Begins in my opinion was also influenced by the first two X-Men films which tried to take the most realistic approach possible. They is also a trend in Hollywood for taken the realistic approach, such as Casino Royale, Lord of the Rings (as in the battle scenes) and the Bourne Trilogy.\n\nI can't wait for The Dark Knight to come out in the cinema.",

        "reviewText": "Batman redone. It gives us a new origin of Batman (Christian Bale) and how he got his powers and such. He still plays playboy Bruce Wayne while fighting evil as Batman. His first two villains are the Scarecrow (Cillain Murphy) who produces intense fear in his victim with a gas and Ra's Al Ghul--who trained Batman and knows ALL his weaknesses.\n\nOK--it's MUCH better then Tim Burton's dreadful movies but I still wasn't too impressed. I didn't like the new origin at all and it's a full hour before Batman even shows up! It does have good parts--Bale is dead on perfect as Bruce Wayne AND Batman. He also pumped up for the role (we have at least two shirtless scenes). It LOOKS great (if very dark) and it has elaborate special effects left and right (with tons of explosions thrown in too). But I was mostly bored. The training sequence at the beginning just went on endlessly--it was more like The Shadow's origin than Batmans. Also this movie was WAY too heavy on darkness and atmosphere. At one point it was raining and I noticed nobody in Gotham pulled in their clothes from their lines. This isn't nit picking but obviously it was all out there to add an \"atmosphere\" to the scene. Also when you find yourself worrying about little things like that the movie just isn't doing its job (i.e. entertaining you). However Batman's costume, the Batcave and the Batmobile are all explained pretty logically.\n\nActing varies--Bale was just great. Michael Caine (as Alfred) matched him. Even Katie Holmes (a limited actress) was good--too bad she won't be in the sequel (this inexplicable romance/marriage with Tom Cruise is destroying her career). Laim Neeson was very dull as a teacher--he appeared to be drugged out. Gary Olman was (suprisingly) terrible as Jim Gordon--he seems VERY unsure of how to play the role. But Rutger Hauer, Linus Roache (who bears an uncanny resemblance to Bale) and Morgan Freeman were all great.\n\nTo be totally honest I looked at my watch more than once. I couldn't wait for this thing to get over. All the praise this is getting is beyond me. I give it a 7--and that's mostly for the acting.",

        "reviewText": "This is certainly, without question the best Batman film ever made, although that isn't saying much. Christopher Nolan makes this into a very dark and brooding tale that tells more about Bruce Wayne than Batman, something the other movies would never have done. Nolan is a great director and he takes a great leap of faith by showing perhaps the most important screen superhero in such a way that the city of Gotham and its components don't feel like taken from a comic book, but from real life. Batman Begins is based more on graphic novels and the original characters by Bob Kane, so the realism and details are there without all the fluff and showboating Joel Schumacher would have put out. Christian Bale is perfect as the title character and he creates a more interesting Bruce Wayne than Batman only because we see more of Wayne in this installment. All other roles are perfectly cast, especially Liam Neeson as a mysterious yet intelligent and brutal member of the League of Shadows. Katie Holmes is nice and sweet as Wayne's childhood friend, and there will never be another Alfred as long as Michael Caine resides.\n\nSimply put, Batman Begins is worth the time and money. It pulls you into a world you would never expect to see in a Batman movie, than transports you to Gothan City, the rotting core of it mostly. When we do get a glimpse of Batman, it really is quite different than other interpretations. The action here is based more on suspense than violence and the plot moves along quite well to make this movie feel shorter than its 140 minute running time. So, if you are going to see The Dark Knight this weekend, be sure to check this out first. Indeed, if it is anything like this one, this franchise is going somewhere truly spectacular.",

      "text": "The film's story is divided into three time-lines:\n\n-Blue represents the present\n\n-Red represents close flashbacks, which deal with Bruce Wayne 3 years earlier\n\n-Green represents distant flashbacks, which deal with Bruce Wayne aged 8 years old\n\nIn the present and close flashbacks, Bruce Wayne is played by Christian Bale and Rachel Dawes is played by Katie Holmes. In distant flashbacks, Bruce Wayne is played by Gus Lewis and Rachel Dawes is played by Emma Lockhart.\n\nA large swarm of bats fly from left to right of shot. Back-lighted by a reddish sky, they make the shape of Batman's emblem.\n\nDistant flashback: Bruce Wayne and Rachel Dawes are playing in the Wayne Manor garden. Bruce falls down an sealed up well and fractures his arm. He is then attacked by a swarm of bats emerging from a large gaping crack at the well base.\n\nPresent: Bruce wakes up from the nightmare in a Chinese prison. It becomes apparent that Bruce is regularly attacked by other inmates who brawl with him 6 to 1 at breakfast. Having beaten the majority of them, Bruce is punished with solitary confinement by the prison guards. In solitary, Bruce is approached by a man called Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson). Ducard displays a great deal of knowledge and authority by getting an audience with Bruce from the prison and by stating that he knows who Bruce is. Ducard then offers Bruce a place in the League of Shadows -- a collective of vigilantes and assassins. He deems that the League can offer Bruce a path to true justice instead of 'locking himself away with criminals to take them on one at a time.' Ducard arranges for Bruce to be released in the morning, when he will have to decide whether he will accept Ducard's offer. Should he do so he must pick a rare blue flower from the eastern slopes and carry it to the top of a nearby mountain.\n\nBruce is released, as promised, and carries out his task. After carrying the flower to the top of the mountain, Bruce finds himself at the door of the League of Shadows headquarters. Inside he meets Ra's al Ghul (Ken Watanabe), the head of the League, and is confronted by Henri Ducard once again. Bruce hands over the blue flower and in doing so completes his test for membership. Ducard then suddenly attacks him, warning the exhausted Bruce that 'death does not wait for you to be ready.' Although Bruce fights back he is easily beaten and collapses.\n\nDistant flashback: Bruce is still in the well after being attacked by the bats. His father, Dr. Thomas Wayne (Linus Roache), comes down to rescue him and sets Bruce's fractured arm with the help of the family butler Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Caine). Thomas Wayne comforts Bruce by asking 'Why do we fall? So we can learn to pick ourselves up'. Later on Bruce admits to his father that he was scared of the bats and is now suffering nightmares. After being comforted further, Thomas shows his son the pearl necklace he'll give to his wife as a gift.\n\nThat night, Thomas and Martha take Bruce to the opera via monorail. While on the train, Thomas confides that the city is in an economic downturn, and his company Wayne Enterprises funded the construction of the trains, routing them into the center of the city. Thomas, however, leaves running of the company to more interested people, preferring to work as a doctor at the hospital. While watching the opera Mefistofele Bruce is frightened by the bats in the production, which remind him of the bats that attacked him and asks his father if they can leave. Outside, in an alleyway, a man named Joe Chill (Richard Brake) accosts them with a revolver and demands the pearl necklace Thomas gave to Martha. A fight breaks out, and in the struggle, both Thomas and Martha are shot and are mortally wounded. Chill runs away, leaving Bruce alone with his parents. Before dying, Thomas manages to tell Bruce, \"Don't be afraid....\"\n\nThat night, Bruce is watched after at the police station by officer James Gordon (Gary Oldman). Midway through, police commissioner Gillian B. Loeb (Colin MacFarlane) comes in and informs Bruce that the police have caught Chill.\n\nBruce is put into Alfred's care. After the funeral, Wayne Enterprises CEO William Earle (Rutger Hauer) tells Bruce that the company will be looked after until Bruce grows up. Alfred tries to console Bruce when the boy confesses that his parents' deaths were his fault because he asked to leave the opera early.\n\nPresent: Ducard asks Bruce if he still feels responsible for the death of his parents. Bruce responds that his is far too angry to feel guilty. His training with the League of Shadows begins. He is trained in the arts of ninjitsu, stealth, combat theatricality and deception. Bruce is trained not only to fight 6 men but to 'engage 600.'\n\nDucard enforces his belief that all forms of crime must be fought without mercy and pity. Ducard explains that his wife was murdered and that he joined the League when he achieved his vengeance. Bruce reveals that he can't claim his vengeance.\n\nClose flashback: 14 years after his parents were killed, Bruce arrives at Wayne Manor from Princeton University; he's come home for Joe Chill's parole hearing. Alfred still manages the house and expresses his concern over Bruce. Rachel is now an Assistant District Attorney and takes Bruce to the hearing. Unknown to her, Bruce is concealing a revolver, with which he plans to shoot Chill if he is released.\n\nIn the hearing, Chill expresses remorse for the murder of Bruce's parents and is given parole should he testify against his cellmate, gang boss Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson). However, before Bruce can act, a female assassin posing as a reporter comes up with a pistol in hand and shoots Chill. Bruce watches as Chill bleeds to death and the assassin is arrested.\n\nDriving away after the incident, Rachel lectures Bruce afterward on the difference between justice and revenge and reveals that Gotham City is still suffering because of Falcone's illegal drug empire. Rachel then slaps him harshly when he reveals that he was planning to shoot Chill. She tells him that his father would be ashamed of him.\n\nBruce, convinced that he has nothing to lose, makes his way to a bar in the Gotham underworld to confront Falcone. Falcone brags about his control over the city's police and judges, even pointing out who he has in his pockets who is present. He then threatens Rachel and Alfred to prove that Bruce does have a lot to lose. His thugs beat up Bruce and he leaves. Left no other choice but to run away, Bruce stows away aboard a cargo ship leaving the port.\n\nBruce is then shown in China stealing food to survive and eventually getting involved in gangster operations in order to infiltrate them. He is then arrested - ironically, in the act of stealing Wayne Enterprises crates - and sent to the prison Ducard discovered him in at the beginning.\n\nPresent: When Bruce reaches a skill level in which he is an equal to the majority in the League, he faces Ducard in combat. However, he is exposed beforehand to the vapors of the blue flower he brought up to the mountain earlier. The smoke distorts his senses and makes him hallucinate about bats, his greatest fear. Bruce overcomes his phobia and employs a clever trick to best Ducard in a sword fight, passing the trial.\n\nRa's al Ghul sends for him and Ducard. Ra's puts Bruce to one final task before becoming a full member of the League. The task is to execute a prisoner of the League -- a man who has stolen his neighbour's land and killed them. Bruce refuses -- when Ducard tells him that his compassion will be a weakness, Bruce tells him that it's too important to simply deny. Ra's reveals to Bruce that he has been trained in order to lead the League to Gotham City, which is corrupted by evil to such an extent that it must be razed. Bruce sets a diversion, and lights the League's headquarters on fire and is forced to fight al Ghul while the the rest of the League escapes the wreckage to safety. Ducard is knocked out by Bruce who then manages to fend off Ra's, who is killed instantly when a roof beam collapses on him. Bruce picks up an unconscious Ducard and rescues him from the building as it explodes. Bruce leaves Ducard in the care of a villager.\n\nBruce contacts Alfred, who arrives in a private jet to pick him up. Alfred reveals that Bruce, who has been away for seven years, has been legally declared dead by William Earle so that Earle can take Wayne Enterprises public. Bruce says it's a good thing he willed everything to Alfred, who jokes that Bruce is welcome to borrow the Rolls-Royce....so long as he brings it back with a full tank. Bruce explains to Alfred a plan he has to fight the Gotham underworld by taking on a new persona, which all criminals will fear.\n\nIn Gotham, a serial killer named Victor Zsaz (Tim Booth), who is allegedly insane, is being transferred from a regular prison to the Arkham Asylum on the opinion of Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy). Rachel challenges Crane since Zsaz is yet another one of Falcone's thugs that Crane has had moved to the Asylum and away from prison, and goes unnoticed due to Falcone's corrupt influence. Dr. Crane meets with Falcone later on that night and demands that Rachel be dealt with. When Falcone refuses, Crane threatens him with the knowledge that his unknown boss is coming to the city -- Falcone is clearly intimidated by the mention of Crane's employer.\n\nHoled up in Wayne Manor, Bruce begins to work out what has happened since he has been away. While doing so he spots a bat flying around the ceiling. He goes back to the abandoned well and climbs down. Through the crack in which the bats appeared when he was attacked in his childhood, Bruce finds a huge cave filled with bats, which is connected to the lowest foundations of Wayne Manor. Coming to terms with his fear he establishes the cave as his base of operations.\n\nBruce decides to announce his return and reports to Wayne Enterprises, where he makes a dramatic entrance to his own company's building by seducing a secretary into playing office golf. Earle, clearly shocked, warns him that he cannot prevent the company from going public at this later stage. Bruce explains that he is not bothered by this and that all he wants is a job, preferably in Applied Sciences.\n\nEarle sets this up and Bruce goes to meet his new 'boss', his father's best friend Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman). Fox explains to Bruce that the Applied Sciences Department is a dead end, where Earle can reassign employees he considers troublemakers. Fox introduces Bruce to some of the equipment he's invented, that Bruce finds worthy. One is a special bulletproof Nomex survival suit, a Kevlar suit that will stop knives and any gun but a straight shot. It was meant for military use, but it apparently never caught on because the Army didn't think soldiers' lives were worth the $300,000 cost. Other items Fox shows to Bruce include a grappling gun and a safety harness. Bruce casually asks Fox if he can 'borrow' the gear for spelunking. Fox allows it, considering all the equipment to belong to Bruce anyway, though he is curious why Bruce is expecting to run into a lot of gunfire in the caves he's exploring.\n\nBruce continues to explore the cave where he and Alfred find the lower foundations of the southeast wing of Wayne Manor and an old elevator shaft leading back up the house. Bruce also begins to modify the battle suit he borrowed adding bat-shaped gauntlets and spray-painting it a dark black.\n\nA few nights later, Bruce dons a ski mask and the grappling gear, goes to the police station, and breaks into Gordon's office, recognizing Gordon, who since we last saw him has been promoted to sergeant, to be one of the city's few incorruptible cops. By threatening him with a staple gun behind his back, Bruce questions Gordon on what it would take to bring Falcone to justice. Gordon responds that leverage on the corrupt Judge Faden and a D.A. brave enough to prosecute will be needed. Bruce tells him to watch for his sign, then escapes by jumping off the roof across to the next building, injuring himself in the process. Gordon tries to give chase, but it proves worthless to chase a random nut.\n\nBruce realizes now that he needs a lightweight fabric to make a glider wing or parachute. He goes back to Fox and asks if there is any technology there that would suit him for 'BASE-jumping.' Fox shows him a special material called memory cloth, which is designed so that the molecules realign to form any type of rigid shape when an electric current passes through it. Bruce then takes interest in a tank-like vehicle called the Tumbler. As he drives it around an open warehouse floor, Fox explains that it was built as a bridging vehicle for the army. It is able to accelerate to high speeds, is tricked out with a variety of gadgets and weapons, and has a booster rocket that can send the vehicle into a \"rampless\" jump. At the end of the session, Fox asks Bruce what he thinks of the Tumbler. Bruce only has one question: \"Does it come in black?\"\n\nBack in the cave, Bruce adds further modifications to his suit, adding a radio transmitter, a cowling, the memory cloth, and a utility belt. He makes steel shurikens in the shape of a bat. He explains to Alfred that he has chosen the bat as his symbol because bats frighten him and it's time that his \"enemies shared his dread.\"\n\nAt the docks, Falcone and a corrupt police officer, Arnold Flass (Mark Boone Junior), are watching Falcone's thugs unload a shipment of drugs from an inbound cargo ship. The drugs are concealed in toys -- stuffed bears and rabbits. The bears are to go to the drug dealers and the rabbits to a mystery man in the Narrows -- a poverty-stricken area of Gotham overrun by crime. However, three of the thugs mysteriously vanish leaving nothing but a loud scream as they vanish into the darkness. As the others investigate, more disappear. The Batman quickly disposes of the remaining thugs and attacks Falcone.\n\nGordon and his officers arrive to find the drugs and disarmed thugs at the scene and Falcone bound to a searchlight with his coat cut in such a way as to produce the shadow of a bat in the night sky.\n\nMeanwhile, Rachel is getting off a monorail train, while being shadowed by two of Falcone's thugs. She notices one and threatens him with a taser. He runs in fear when he sees Batman beating up the second thug. As Rachel turns she screams at the sight of Batman. He produces photographs compromising Judge Faden and then disappears as a police officer shows up.\n\nThe news the next day of a 'Batman' has the whole city talking. Loeb is not happy that a vigilante is doing the job the police are meant to do, in spite of Gordon's defense that the vigilante did hand them Falcone on a platter. Rachel and the D.A.'s office decide that there is enough evidence to put Falcone on trial despite it been given to them by a vigilante.\n\nAlfred wakes Bruce up at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, despite Bruce's pleas for more sleep, and then frets over the bruises and injuries that he has taken the previous night. He shows Bruce a news story about his adventure from the night before and informs Bruce that he must live the life he would normally in public in order not to raise suspicion - doing such things as drive exotic sports cars, date movie stars, buy things that are not for sale, etc. He also tells Bruce that the bruises he's sporting now need an excuse, like playing polo, which Bruce says he won't do.\n\nEarle, meanwhile, gets word that a Wayne Tech Enterprise weapon, a microwave emitter, has been stolen from one of their cargo ships, and the crew of said ship has apparently been killed. The emitter is another military weapon, which uses focused microwaves to vaporize an enemy's water supply.\n\nBruce takes Alfred's advice quite to the extreme. This starts with him going to a Wayne Enterprises party at a hotel with two female escorts, who almost get Bruce kicked out by bathing in the decorative fountain, a situation Bruce resolves by writing a check and purchasing the hotel on the spot. There he meets Rachel for the first time since returning from China. Although he tries to convince her that the way he is acting isn't really him, she tells him that \"it's not who you are underneath, but what you do that defines you.\"\n\nFalcone has cut his wrists in prison to bolster his insanity plea and enable a move to Arkham Asylum. Dr. Crane is brought in to assess his \"insanity\". Once they're alone, Falcone demands that Dr. Crane move him in return for Falcone not suggesting the police have a closer look at the drugs he has been trafficking for Dr. Crane. Dr. Crane thinks for a moment about what to do. He then asks Falcone if he wants to see the mask he uses in his experiments at the Asylum, which he says the patients can't stand. He pulls a burlap-sack mask out of his briefcase. He releases gas from his suitcase and puts on the mask, which acts as an air filter. Falcone screams with fear at the hallucinations caused by the gas, which make the mask more terrifying. Dr. Crane is next seen leaving the room with his masked stored away, while Falcone's screams can still be heard. Dr. Crane tells the warden that Falcone isn't faking and should be moved to the Asylum.\n\nThe following night Batman pays a visit to Gordon and tells him that only half the drugs brought in on Falcone's ship were to be sent to the dealers. He and Gordon conclude that it would help to interrogate Flass, who Batman identified at the docks making his escape. Flass is pickpocketing money from a falafel vendor on the street. As he walks away into a narrow alley, he springs a trap and is flown upside-down to the rooftops, suspended from Batman's grappling cord. Threatened by Batman, Flass tells him about the bear and rabbit shipments, that the rabbits make their way to the Narrows, and that there is some other substance hidden in the rabbits. Batman returns Flass to the ground and disappears. Meanwhile, Rachel's boss, Carl Finch, is quietly murdered by an assassin disguised as a police officer when he finds Wayne Enterprises' missing microwave emitter in one of Falcone's containers.\n\nBatman makes his way back to the Narrows and finds an apartment riddled with cuddly rabbit toys stuffed with the drugs. At that moment Dr. Crane and two of his men enter and Batman hides. At Dr. Crane's orders, the thugs douse gasoline around the apartment. Batman comes out of hiding and beats the two thugs. Dr. Crane, wearing his burlap mask, emerges and gasses him with the same gas he used on Falcone, using gas cylinders hidden in his shirt cuffs. Batman falls helplessly to the floor and scrambles around hallucinating bats and his parents' death. Dr. Crane douses him in gasoline while taunting him. He then lights a cigarette lighter and throws it at Batman's chest, causing his suit to burst into flames. Batman throws himself out of the window into the rain swept streets of the Narrows and hits the street with a thud. Desperately rolling around he puts out the flames, to the shock of the on-lookers, and then stumbles about trying to get his grapple gun. He fires the gun upwards and is carried to to a nearby rooftop. From there he grabs his communicator and calls for Alfred to help him. Alfred arrives and takes Batman into the car and drives him to the Manor. Still suffering the effects of the aerosol Crane sprayed him with, Bruce yammers, telling him to 'take poison...blood...blood poison', before passing out.\n\nHearing his father's voice asking 'Bruce, why do we fall?\", Bruce wakes up in his bed as if from a nightmare. Alfred reveals that he has been unconscious for two days and that today is his birthday -- 'many happy returns.' Bruce tells him that he has felt the effects of whatever Dr. Crane used on him before but not as strongly. Fox comes in and warns Bruce against 'hanging out in the wrong nightclubs' and after making a point of how hard he has worked to save Bruce, explains that he has created an antidote to the toxic gas. When asked if he could make any more of the antidote, Fox expresses concern that Bruce is willing to 'go back to the same club' and gas himself again, but he promises to bring what he has. He also explains that the antidote will inoculate people against the toxin.\n\nRachel turns up at the Manor to give Bruce his birthday present and to apologize that she can't make his birthday party that night. Her boss has been missing for two days; she jokes bitterly about searching the river for his body. She cuts away from the conversation as she get a text message informing her that Falcone has been moved from prison to Arkham on Dr. Crane's orders. She rushes off to challenge Dr. Crane's decision. Knowing the she is in danger from Dr. Crane, Bruce changes to Batman, despite the guests who will soon arrive for his party.\n\nRachel arrives at Arkham and watches Falcone -- now genuinely insane -- mumbling the word \"Scarecrow\" over and over. When she questions Dr. Crane on the meaning of scarecrow, Dr. Crane explains that a significant number of inmates focus their paranoia on an external tormentor, such as a scarecrow. Both are unaware that Batman is listening from outside. When Rachel demands that Falcone be evaluated by Dr. Lehmann, the court's psychiatrist, Dr. Crane leads her into the lower floors of the Asylum, where he reveals inmates who are pouring a toxin into the water pipes below. Rachel runs for it but Dr. Crane catches her, now wearing his burlap mask, and gasses her with his toxin. A terrified Rachel is interrogated by Dr. Crane in the basement. Suddenly the lights go out. Dr. Crane acknowledges that the Batman has arrived. He tells the guards not to worry about Rachel as she has been given a concentrated dose and will not last long, but to phone the police. He explains that the police can't stop the toxin, but Batman might -- unless the police stop him first.\n\nAlthough Dr. Crane's henchmen are prepared, Batman appears in the basement and overcomes them all easily. He gasses Crane with his own toxin. With Crane hallucinating that Batman's mask has become monstrously frightening, Crane lets slip that he is working for Ra's al Ghul before Batman slams him into a wall, knocking him unconscious. Batman picks up Rachel and takes her high up on the landing before the huge stairway at Arkham's entrance. The police arrive. Not willing to wait for backup in the form of a SWAT team as Flass is, Gordon goes into the building and is grabbed by Batman. The SWAT teams arrive. Batman explains to Gordon that he needs to get Rachel to his hideout so he can give her the antidote to the toxin. But Batman can't escape the SWAT team while carrying Rachel, so he asks Gordon carry her to the alley outside on the Narrows side. He then activates a device in the heel of his boot, which emits a high-pitched signal, that Batman calls his \"backup\". Gordon takes Rachel down the stairway as the SWAT crew raids the building. As they begin to set up, a huge swarm of bats breaks into the building in response to Batman's signal. With bats everywhere distracting the SWAT officers, Batman drops from the stairway using his cape to land safely. He breaks into the prisoners' area, courteously apologizing for disturbing the inmates, and uses explosives to break outside. There he meets Gordon and takes Rachel from him.\n\nBatman refuses further help from Gordon, knowing he can't take him too, and gets into the Tumbler. He hurries Rachel back to the Manor, with police cars and helicopters in hot pursuit. A very dramatic car chase ensues as Batman weaves through parking garage ramps, over church roofs, underground tunnels, and highways, destroying multiple police cars with evasive manuevers and caltrops to blow out their tires and the vehicle's stealth technology, making it invisible to the police helicopters chasing him. He returns to the Batcave to find that Fox has delivered three vials of the toxin's antidote, one of which he uses to save Rachel.\n\nGordon gets a report from the detectives studying the toxin in the water. Gotham's whole water system is laced with the stuff; it must have taken weeks to prepare the material. No one has noticed anything up to now because the toxin apparently has no effect unless it's inhaled.\n\nMeanwhile, Rachel wakes up inside the cave and Batman explains what has happened. He tells her he is going to sedate her and when she wakes up she will be at home with the two remaining vials of the antidote. She must get them to Gordon -- one for him to inoculate himself and one for mass production. He sedates her and gets changed for his party.\n\nBruce tells Alfred about Rachel and asks him to take her home. He goes to the party downstairs to a chorus of Happy Birthday. He meets Earle, who tells him that the stock offering was a success; the buyers were mostly trusts and brokerages. Bruce finds Fox and thanks him for the antidote vials that he delivered. Bruce then tells him what has happened. Fox interrupts that the water won't help disperse an inhalant. He stops and thinks. He says the stolen the microwave emitter could vaporize all the water in the mains, releasing the toxin. He reveals that he has been fired by Earle for asking too many questions about it. Bruce asks him to break into Wayne Enterprises and begin making more antidote.\n\nBruce is carted off unwillingly to another section of the party by Mrs. Delane. When she insists that he must meet a man called Ra's al Ghul, she suddenly has Bruce's attention. As the figure turns around, it is clearly not Ra's. Bruce whispers that he watched Ra's die. A familiar voice from behind asks 'but is Ra's al Ghul immortal? Are his methods supernatural?' Bruce turns around to the sight of Henri Ducard. Bruce thinks slowly before figuring out that Ducard is the true Ra's and the man Bruce fought back at the League of Shadows HQ was a decoy. Ra's muses that they both have double identities. He then lectures Bruce on the weakness of compassion. Even though Bruce had saved his life, he will still destroy Gotham.\n\nRa's gives Bruce a chance to get the innocent guests out of the house, which he does by acting drunk and insulting them. After Bruce demands his guests leave him in peace, he and Ra's walk together. Ra's explains that Crane's fear toxin is derived from the blue flowers back in China and that he found a way of weaponising it. Crane, however, is not a member of the League of Shadows and his idea of the plan was that they would hold the city to ransom. Ra's explains that Gotham must be destroyed because of how corrupt it is -- which he illustrates by explaining that the League of Shadows has infiltrated every level of its infrastructure. The scene is intercut with a series of shots showing members of the League disguised as officials and police officers releasing people from Arkham -- including Victor Zsaz and Crane, who, still under the effects of his own fear toxin, only mumbles 'scarecrow.'\n\nBack at the Manor, Ra's offers Bruce one last chance to join and help the League, which Bruce refuses, claiming that there are still good people in the city and that Gotham isn't beyond saving. Ra's nods to other League members, who set fire to the mansion. Ra's explains that Gotham has been attacked by the League before through economics, which caused the depression when Bruce was a child. Ra's hoped that the city would destroy itself through the unequal distribution of wealth, however certain members of the rich families, such as Bruce's parents, donated money to help Gotham recover. But Ra's is back to the finish the job. With this Ra's attacks Bruce and pushes him in the way of a falling beam which pins an unconscious Bruce to the floor. With Wayne Manor burning around him Ra's says 'Justice is balance. You burned down my house and left me for dead. Consider us even.'\n\nMeanwhile the Narrows is in a state of panic as hundreds of rapists and murders are freed from the Asylum. Rachel wakes up in her bed with the two vials of antidote.\n\nAlfred arrives back at Wayne Manor and uses a golf club to knock out a League member guarding the house. Praying that the man was not a member of the fire department, Alfred rushes into the burning house and rouses Bruce. Managing to free himself, Bruce is led to the cave by Alfred as the house collapses.\n\nAlfred inspects Bruce for injuries as Bruce is torn about the destruction of his father's house. Alfred tells him that the Wayne legacy is more than bricks and mortar and quotes Thomas Wayne: 'Why do we fall, sir? So that we can learn to pick ourselves up.'\n\nPolice in full strength are moving from central Gotham across the bridge to the Narrows island. Rachel, being a D.A., is allowed to pass. She finds Gordon and gives him the antidote. Gordon explains that they are going to raise the bridges to the island and they need to get Rachel off before they do.\n\nOne last SWAT van is allowed over to the Narrows secretly carrying Ra's, a handful of his henchmen and the microwave emitter. A train, on the overhead Wayne line is stopped by the League where the Microwave emitter is being prepared to be hoisted up to it. While the drawbridges are raised, Ra's sets off the machine causing all of the water in the pipes below the streets to vaporize and blow the pipes open in the Narrows. The toxin is released and affects everyone in the Narrows including the escaped convicts and the police alike. Gordon inoculates himself with the antidote and finds a fearful Flass ready to shoot two innocent and equally frightened teenagers. Gordon knocks him out and handcuffs him to a railing. Meanwhile the few remaining people of the Gotham Police force wonder what is going on.\n\nThe Narrows begins to tear itself apart. In the streets, people violently attack one another. Rachel is confronted by Crane on a horse whose previous rider, a riot cop, is dragged behind. Wearing his burlap mask, Crane announces to her his new alias, 'the Scarecrow.'\n\nGordon requests reinforcements but to his dismay he is told that all of the riot police are already on the island and there is no one left to send. Suddenly the Tumbler jumps across the gap from Gotham to the Narrows. Batman explains to Gordon that Ra's intends to use the train to carry the microwave emitter to Wayne Tower. When the train reaches Wayne Tower at the center of Gotham, the microwave emitter will vaporise the contents of all the water mains, covering the whole city with the toxin and creating mass panic beyond the Narrows. He asks Gordon for help and gives him the key to the Tumbler.\n\nThe Scarecrow is about to run down Rachel. She fires her taser and hits him in the face. His horse carries him away screaming. Rachel is surrounded by a dozen inmates from Arkham, including the serial killer Mr. Zsasz, carrying a knife. Batman jumps from above them, cracking Zsasz over the head, picks up Rachel and carries her to a rooftop and to safety. As Batman leaves her she asks him who he is. He replies 'It's not who I am underneath, but what I do that defines me' -- quoting her own words back at her. She says 'Bruce?' as he jumps from the rooftop and uses his memory cloth cape as a glider. As he seemingly flies in the air, the fearful people below shriek in terror as their hallucinations warp the sight of him. Gordon orders the main bridge to be lowered and starts up the Tumbler.\n\nRa's is overseeing the madness below as his men fasten the microwave emitter into place on board the train. He spots Batman gliding towards him. Batman lands on the train platform. Ra's comments that he took his advice on theatricality a bit too literally and boards the train. Four members of the League appear and prevent Batman from pursuing. During the fight, Batman tries to uses his grapple hook to secure himself to the train but it is knocked out of his hand. The fight takes all participants down to the street floor where Batman manages to overcome all four League members. However he is ganged up on by dozens of terrified and angry citizens. As Ra's starts the train overhead, Batman finds his grapple gun and fires it at the train. He's dragged behind the train. Gordon meanwhile is following the Tumbler's GPS system toward Wayne Tower.\n\nAs the bridges are lowered, Ra's's train breaks the water pipes, releasing the toxic gas. The Tumbler is not far behind. Batman manages to pull himself to the train. He smashes through one of the train windows and engages an infuriated Ra's. Batman takes Ra's sword and breaks it in two with his gauntlets. Distracting Ra's, he stabs the sword into the braking controls of the train. Gordon arrives at Wayne Tower. He arms the Tumbler's defense systems and fires missiles at a train rail foundation. With the train approaching Wayne Tower, Ra's gets the upper hand over Batman and taunts him: 'Don't be afraid, Bruce. You are just an ordinary man in a cape. That's why you couldn't fight injustice, that's why you can't stop this train.' Batman replies, 'who said anything about stopping it?' Ra's looks up and notices a half of his sword sticking in the brake control. As this happens Gordon destroys the foundation and breaks the railway line with the Tumbler's missiles. With this distraction, Batman regains the upper hand and pins Ra's. Batman explains that he won't kill Ra's -- but he doesn't have to save him, either. He blows out the back end of the train car, throws himself out, and glides away. Ra's can only look up to watch the train propel itself off the line and into the street below. The microwave emitter is damaged by the impact and explodes, destroying the whole train.\n\nThe next day, Earle arrives at Wayne Enterprises to chair a meeting. He'd shocked to find that the meeting has already begun -- and is led by Fox, who reveals he has Earle's job.\n\nBruce is in the back of his car reading a newspaper: Batman has made the front page and Bruce is on page 8 under the headline 'Drunken Billionaire Burns Down Home.' He takes a call from Earle, who asks on what authority Bruce can decide who runs Wayne Enterprises. Bruce states that he is the owner. Earle reminds him that the company has gone public. Bruce explains that he bought most of the shares through various trusts and brokerages. Fox agrees with Bruce's words, and asks Earle, \"Didn't you get the memo?\" in reference to the words Earle told him when firing him from AS.\n\nBack at Wayne Manor, Bruce is nailing boards over the old well in the garden when he is approached by Rachel. He apologizes for not telling her about his identity earlier. She apologizes for slapping him the day Chill died and for the horrible things that she said before he disappeared. Bruce tells her that what she said was true and that he was just a coward with a gun. He thanks her. She says that when she heard that he was back she began to hope. She moves closer towards him and kisses him. She then explains that she then found out about his mask -- his actual face. She explains that his true face is the cowl of Batman and that the boy she loved long ago never came back. But maybe one day they can be together when Batman is no longer needed. Bruce nods. Rachel tells him that she was wrong and that Bruce's father would be proud of him, just as she is.\n\nAlfred is walking through the rubble of the Manor and Rachel asks Bruce about what he will do. Bruce replies that he'll rebuild it just the way it was before. Rachel turns to leave. Alfred wonders if it's a good time to improve the foundations of the south-east corner. Bruce agrees and they walk off.\n\nThat night, Batman meets Gordon, who reveals that he has recently been made a lieutenant. Gordon has also made a version of the signal that Batman had made with Falcone. Gordon talks about how the Narrows are lost to a new crime wave and the escalation between law enforcement methods and criminal methods such as the police wearing Kevlar leading to criminals buying armor-piercing ammunition. He expresses concern that the city's dependence on Batman may have negative consequences. Gordon uses a recent case as an example: a criminal with a taste for theatrics whom has killed two people. The suspect leaves a calling card at the scene of each crime. Gordon gives Batman the evidence: a Joker playing card (see The Dark Knight (2008)). Batman says that he will look into it. Batman then assures Gordon that they can make Gotham safe again and he jumps from the roof and glides away."

        "reviewText": "I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. \n\nThe first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. \n\nSo, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.\n\nP.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle.",

The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well.",

In hindsight, the theatrical release seemed to have been cut down for general audiences and unfortunately, elucidating scenes went with it. This is a story of a disillusioned and hurting Batman who is on the path to villainy before ironically discovering renewed hope and faith through trying to take on the one person his rage is pointed to - Superman. I think the Martha scene is fundamentally misunderstood and so much more poignant than it gets credit for: a mirror is held up to Batman and he finally realizes what Alfred had been trying to tell him - that he has become the type of person he originally swore to bring to justice.\n\nWhile I do agree that the script could have been rewritten slightly to make the interactions and motives between the characters a bit clearer, it is ultimately a very unique, refreshingly dark story grounded in hope and sets the stage for what was to come.\n\nLastly, the marketing for this movie was so spoilery! Had Wonder Woman's arrival in the final fight been kept out of the trailers (for example), the moment upon first viewing would have been EPIC. General message to marketers: learn to tease better.",

Maybe people came to this movie expecting another superhero movie with a lot of action and epic moments and not expecting a thought provoking one which made them hate it. And if you think about it this theme of testing your characters, putting them under impossible odds and making them react in very \"human\" ways started in Man of Steel.\n\nClark not saving his father and his father sacrificing himself to protect his son from being exposed to the world when he knows that his son is not ready, such an impactful scene.\n\nOr the one with Zod forcing Superman to choose between killing him or letting the family die, a situation in which there was no happy outcome which was emphasized in Superman's heartbreaking scream after he snapped Zod's neck.\n\nSomething you don't usually see in superhero movies and still people criticized that movie for both of those scenes. Zack Snyder is not the best director there is but he makes movies that you come back to after years later and see them in a new and different light and he actually said it himself, his movies are directed to the adult audience not the kids.\n\nSnyder is aware of how different his interpretation of Batman is to all other interpretations you've been exposed to all your life. It's a story of a broken man who lost too much and changed in the process with his anger directed towards all these people that \"he\" considers as criminals including Superman. Which in my interpretation the mentioning of his mother's name \"Martha\" brought him back to the reality, to the beginning, the trigger of what made him become this knight in the dark to what he was when he first started and what he has become.\n\nI love Batman v Superman.",

It's not required to have seen \"Man of Steel\" to understand the full nuance of Batman's (Ben Affleck) distrust of Superman (Henry Cavill) in \"Dawn of Justice\", but it doesn't hurt. I caught both films pretty much back to back so for me it was like one long story. What I particularly liked seeing was the insinuation of future characters in the unfolding universe, Flash and Aquaman were on quick display here. Gal Gadot had an impressive appearance as Wonder Woman in the film, the way she teamed up with the titled heroes to take down Doomsday was done effectively. I had read a fair number of reviews on this board and no one mentioned how this one ended, so I won't spoil it either. By now though, we know for a certainty that death in comics or the movies is no longer as certain as taxes, and that final little blip before the credits roll inform us that all's well in the next chapter. With everything else going on, the best sight gag in the story by a street protester was an effective commentary on the state of immigration in the country today: Superman = Illegal Alien.

        "reviewText": "Well, the wait is finally over. Batman and Superman are in a big screen film together for the first time in history. The result? A sloppy attempt at setting up the DC Universe. Batman v Superman has its moments though with great performances from almost every one and action that could rival Man of Steel, but it was difficult to not walk out of this film and feel overwhelmingly disappointed. For a film that finished filming over a year ago, you would think Zack Snyder and Warner Bros would make all the effort in the world to edit in and out the stuff that's important and tighten the movie, but that isn't the case. \n\nIt's directed by the aforementioned Snyder and stars almost the entire Man of Steel cast along with Ben Affleck and Jeremy Irons as Batman and Alfred respectively. The performances are mostly great all around, including Amy Adams, who unfortunately felt out of place for most of the film. I have no problem with Adams' portrayal or the character of Lois Lane being in the film, but she was misused and overused here. She and General Swanwick from the first film have several small scenes that are used for us to find out more about Lex Luthor. But the problem is, it's a good 15 minutes of the film that could have shaved down to 3 or 4 minutes worth of scenes.\n\nSpeaking of Lex Luthor, the casting of Jesse Eisenberg caused a big stew of controversy when it was first announced, and I think it was warranted. I've seen the film twice now and had different opinions both times. The first time I was entertained by Lex but also confused as to why they went the route they did with the character. The second time, I was annoyed by the performance and the over the top portrayal of what should be a menacing villain. A few scenes here and there had those classic Luthor aspects that I've loved from the animated series and films, but the tone they went with for Eisenberg's performance just doesn't work. There's little humor in an incredibly dark film, and Lex seems like he's from a completely different film. \n\nThe other big problem the film unfortunately has is its title and marketing. Most of the marketing material was well done and proposed \"the greatest gladiator match in the history of man\", but the reality is that it's merely 10 minutes of a 2 and a half hour film. The fight itself is phenomenal. It doesn't hold a candle to the fight in the comic book/film \"The Dark Knight Returns\", but it's probably the best part of Batman v Superman. The focus was all over the place though. Everything from the fight onto the ending is good cinema, but man does it take a long time to get there. I actually sat in the theater saying to myself \"I'm kind of bored right now\". How in the world does that happen in a superhero film, let alone a Batman film?\n\nThere are still plenty of great aspects to this film, however. Diane Lane has a few heart-warming and gut-wrenching scenes. Laurence Fishburne provides some good comic relief as the head of the Daily Planet, Perry White. Jeremy Irons gives us our most involved and bada** Alfred to date. Even Gal Gadot, another questionable casting choice, showed acting chops that I didn't think she had here and got me excited for the Wonder Woman film next year. Which brings me to the weirdest part about my feelings about this film. As many problems as there are, it didn't get me any less enthused for the future of the DCEU. Some few surprises in the film, tease Justice League which was neat. And I'm incredibly stoked for Ben Affleck's solo Batman film. With that said, I don't think I can get that excited for Justice League if Snyder still directs. I have to believe many of the directing and editing mistakes came from him. But perhaps even Warner Bros themselves needs to take some of the fault for giving Snyder too much reign? Another positive though was Hans Zimmer's score, unsurprisingly. I loved the way him and Junkie XL managed to weave in Superman's theme with the new haunting Batman theme.\n\nBen Affleck may very well be the definitive Batman. Everyone knew his Bruce Wayne would be great but his Batman does not disappoint. There are scenes which rival the action in the Arkham video games in terms of style, creativity, and fluidity. I couldn't be more excited for Affleck to write, direct, and star in the solo film whenever it may come out.\n\nI honestly can't believe I'm sitting here typing an average review for a film that's one of my most anticipated of all time, but I am. There are plenty moments of pure greatness here, but for every incredible scene, there's an unnecessary or strange scene out of place. Sure, I enjoyed the film more the second time I saw it, but I just can't believe how sloppy of a filmmaking job this was. A missed opportunity for Warner Bros for sure.\n\n+Affleck\n\n+Action\n\n+Last 40 minutes are awesome\n\n+Zimmer's score\n\n+Performances\n\n-Except for the tonally off performance by Eisenberg\n\n-Sloppy editing\n\n-Slow and almost boring first half\n\n7.2/10",

I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?\n\nI remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.\n\nI'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.\n\nSo, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.\n\nSurprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. \n\nThe movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!\n\nI can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.\n\nTotal masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a clich√© type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes.",

Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.\n\n2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. \n\n3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. \n\n4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. \n\nB v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old.",

Let me also admit that I have yet to watch the previous Zack Snyder/Henry Cavill Superman movie, Man of Steel. Still, there's plenty of cool action and also many touching scenes especially those between Supes and Lois Lane, who in this one already knows Clark Kent's identity unlike what I previously knew of them from comics thorough the '70s-'80s not to mention the Christopher Reeve movies. My movie theatre-working friend possibly liked it more than I did (he clapped during some of the action scenes) but I didn't come away from this thinking it was worthless...just wondering why certain scenes were done the way they were. Really, I'll just say that for much of the time, I enjoyed Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and leave it at that. Also, Ben Affleck was as good as he could be as Batman and I felt he was okay as Daredevil way back in '03 as well. Okay, I'm done...",

        "reviewText": "After watching it for the third time, second with the Ultimate Cut I can say I love the story, tone and almost everything about the movie except for the writing for Lex and some minor things but the overall feeling of the movie makes up for it. Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL created a soundtrack that fits the movie perfectly. The characters from Man of Steel is improved and is overall better and the addition of Ben Affleck's Batman, Jeremy Irons' Alfred and other characters creates a great ensemble cast and the actors bring great and memorable performances. My take on the story is that it is really realistic, Superman would be seen as a god in a way and I agree fully with Batman's thoughts, look at the Injustice games/comics, simply great writing. The fighting sequences are well choreographed and the warehouse scene, one of my all time favorite live action Batman scenes! There are more powerful action sequences, but the movie is about the politics and drama and not as action heavy as Man of Steel.\n\nHenry Cavill is great in this film but Ben Affleck really steals the spotlight, but the character development that Clark Kent receives is worth it as he's one step closer from becoming the superhero we love and know so well. Ben Affleck's Bruce Wayne and Batman is brilliantly played and written, the character has been criticized for killing as Batman never kills. I understand and I got a problem with it to but I know why he kills in this movie, he's angry but everything comes down to all the loss and depression he suffers. He doesn't have anything good left in the world, Dick Grayson got murdered by The Joker. His only family and probably only friend is Alfred, and when Zod's attack on Metropolis happened, Bruce Wayne saw it up close and witnessed allt he death that these God like beings could do and realistically, he wants to do something to prevent from more harm and its a human thing to do, to hate. Zack Snyder's Bruce Wayne is more flawed than any other portrayals of the character but it might also be the most realistic portrayal of Batman.\n\nLex Luthor's big plan isn't really what you expect from a villain in a comic book movie. It's political and well thought out, something that can highly likely happen in the real world. It's another element that makes the film so great in my eyes, how the writers and Zack Snyder wanted to make the movie realistic and portray Superman in a way that would happen in real life. Jesse Eisenburg plays Lex in a fresh and unique way, not really comic book accurate but I strongly believe that after the character development from this movie he will then become the Lex Luthor we know and love. But I have to admit it, I like Zack Snyder's version of the character and Jesse Eisenburg did a terrific performance as the iconic villain.\n\nMany people doesn't appreciate the dream sequence that's called the Knightmare, I understand why as it drags down the pacing. But why did Zack Snyder choose to place it into the movie? It all comes down to his 5 film plan that he never got to finish, the dream sequence shows us what would possibly happen if Darkseid wins in the future and that means Superman will turn bad. In my opinion it's smart writing.\n\nI understand that this movie isn't for everyone and that's alright, but I love it. The visual storytelling, gritty and realistic tone, original and simply fascinating to look at as the imagery is perfection. Zack Snyder nailed it with the Ultimate Cut and have created an epic superhero film about two of my favorite heroes.\n\n(Edited this after my 4th watch)",

        "reviewText": "I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.\n\nThis film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.\n\nThe villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.\n\nI have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.\n\nMy thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.\n\nAs another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.\n\nWhy would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.\n\nIt is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.\n\nIt seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.\n\nHe has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.\n\nA philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.\n\nIt seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\"",

Too many stories that doesn't get the space they deserve. Released before its time.\n\nThis movie is great. Even with the Martha scene and I'll tell you why. Batman IS a f upped character. Suffered from trauma of his parents death at a young age, watched several of his friends been tortured and died. He feels unbelievable guilt and rage. When superman first shows up and wrecks everything because of zod (equally powerful God). He gets scared. This one threat, that's not only in the center of messing with Gotham, could destroy the planet. This makes sense. Bruce wayne isn't a normal individual no matter how smart and charming he is. His actions are justified and reasonable from his perspective while superman tries to fit in in a world less human than he is.\n\nThis movie was heavy, you need to pay attention. After seeing this 4 times. I still notice something else. Superb action, soundtrack, acting, cinematography and story BUT this movie would make a lot more sense if it were a standalone film without connection to any universe. Or to be released after several other DC films. This was released to quickly to try to compete with the avengers. That was a mistake. So many scenes ended up being confusing for the average movie goer. And know that's snyder is gone, we will not see the full circle in this Phase one of the Dceu. Not perfect by any means. I'm not saying that. But this is not the average superhero movie. Just like batman, drop the killrage. See this film again, (ultimate edition) and try to actually understand it. You can't turn of your brain like many other superhero movies.",

      "text": "Eighteen months after the destructive battle in Metropolis (Man of Steel), Superman has become a controversial figure. Billionaire Bruce Wayne, who has covertly operated in Gotham City as vigilante Batman for nearly two decades, blames Superman for the mass casualties that resulted from his fight with General Zod. Among the casualties were many people working in Wayne Enterprises headquarters when the tower collapsed. Superman, in his public identity as Daily Planet journalist Clark Kent, sees Batman as dangerous and seeks to expose him.\n\nLexCorp's mogul Lex Luthor also sees Superman as a threat and convinces Senator June Finch to help him recover kryptonite from Zod's failed terraforming attempt in the Indian Ocean. Finch later stonewalls Luthor's efforts to use Zod's DNA and the Kryptonian scout ship recovered from the battle to create a biological weapon.\n\nWayne successfully infiltrates a fundraiser promoted by Luthor to retrieve data from LexCorp's mainframe, but his flash drive is stolen by mysterious antiques dealer Diana Prince, who learns that Luthor has files on several \"metahumans\"; beings with superhuman abilities; herself, as well as a man with superhuman speed (Flash), a cybernetic body (Cyborg), and a man that lives underwater (Aquaman). Wayne later receives the drive back from her after she copies it. While decrypting the drive, he has a vision of a dystopian future where he sees a gigantic omega symbol etched into a desert landscape. Armed with a pistol, he leads a force of rebels against Superman. Batman is betrayed by his own men, captured and held prisoner by Superman's army. Superman approaches him, rips off his cowl and tells him he took everything from him. Superman then rips out Batman's heart.\n\nWayne is snapped out of the vision by a mysterious time traveler, who warns him that Lois Lane has a crucial role to an impending threat, and that he must find the others. Before he vanishes, the time traveler yells that he's \"too soon\" with his message. He later learns not only of Luthor's experiments with kryptonite, but also his ongoing investigation about metahumans including Prince herself, who is an immortal warrior. Batman attempts to retrieve Luthor's kryptonite in the Batmobile, but is intercepted by Superman, who orders him to cease his activities. Later, Finch summons Superman to a Congressional hearing at the U.S. Capitol to debate the validity of his actions. Using a man who was paralyzed by Superman's battle with Zod in Metropolis, Luthor masterminds a bombing that kills dozens of people by hiding the bomb in the man's wheelchair. Everyone in the chamber is killed, including Finch. Despite being seen carrying the injured out of the blast-zone, the public blames the bombing on Superman, who goes into self-imposed exile.\n\nBatman retrieves the kryptonite and prepares to launch a strike against Superman; building a powerful exoskeleton and kryptonite-powered arsenal. With Batman now having the kryptonite, Luthor activates the Genesis Chamber aboard the scout ship and splices his own DNA and Zod's. Luthor endangers Lois to lure Superman to LexCorp Tower, where he reveals that he has been aware of Superman's secrets for some time. Luthor blackmails Superman into confronting Batman by holding his adoptive mother, Martha Kent, hostage at an undisclosed location, anticipating that Batman would kill Superman with his kryptonite.\n\nSuperman tries to reason with Batman, revealing that he knows his secrets, but leads to a fight in which Batman nearly kills Superman with a spear he'd fashioned from the kryptonite. Superman pleads for Batman to \"save Martha\", which was also the latter's late mother's name, prompting him to come to his senses and realize Superman is not a threat. Upon learning of Luthor's plan, Batman leaves to rescue Martha while Superman confronts Luthor, who unleashes a monstrous artificially-bred creature (Doomsday) made with Kryptonian technology on the crashed ship.\n\nSuperman and Batman join forces to fight him and are aided by an arriving Prince in her Amazonian attire, but are outmatched due to the creature's ability to absorb and redirect energy, becoming indestructible in the process. Realizing that their shared Kryptonian DNA results in shared vulnerabilities, Superman retrieves the kryptonite spear and impales the creature with it, while the creature stabs Superman with his bony spike, seemingly killing him.\n\nLuthor is arrested after Lane exposes his numerous crimes; when he is visited by Batman in prison, he gloats that Superman's death has made the world vulnerable to powerful threats, of which he was taught about while manipulating the Kryptonian ship's technology. Batman threatens Luthor, and promises that he will always be watching him. A memorial is held for Superman in Metropolis, and as Clark is also declared dead. Wayne, Lane, Martha, and Prince attend a private funeral for Clark in Smallville. Martha passes an envelope to Lane, which contains an engagement ring from Clark. After the funeral, Wayne reveals to Prince that he plans to form a team (the Justice League) from Luthor's file subjects to protect the world in Superman's absence. Later, a faint heartbeat begins echoing from Clark's grave and the dirt around it begins to levitate."

        "reviewText": "The 1989 Batman is the original Dark Knight and Tim Burton's Classic Dark Knight film. This is my number 1 personal favorite Batman of all Batman movies this is my movie and I love this film to death! Jack Nicholson was well-cast as The Joker he was a wonderful in his lead role performance. Michael Keaton was just great as Bruce Wayne/Batman, he acted like the role of Batman was written on his skin. Kim Bassinger did a wonderful performance as her role Vicki Vale. I think Vicky Vale is very underrated character from all other female lead characters in all Batman films. Michael Gough did a wonderful job as the butler Alfred Pennyworth Batman's helper. Seriously Alfred for me will be always Michael Gough not only that he acted much better than Michael Caine did he even showed more heart and caring in the whole Batman franchise than Michael Caine did. The acting in this film is awesome, the character developments and the story plot are TERRIFIC! \n\nMichael Keaton caused an uproar when he was casted as Batman as fans boycotted the idea yet in Christmas 1988 when the trailer hit theaters the silence was shut as it was a nice teaser. This movie was the most hyped movie of 1989 as months audiences including fans had waited even with a second trailer that showed up in the spring of 1989 and merchandise was everywhere as it was the year of the Batman, hell even TV stations had reruns of the 60's Batman show to cash-in on the phenomenon. This movie opened on June 21st 1989 and became one of the highest grossing movies of all time and the biggest movie of the year earning acclaim and making Batman cool again just like Frank Miller and Alan Moore did. The Action and fights sequences were great and awesome. At least so much better than they were in Batman Begins (2005). It was my first Batman film I ever saw and this movie just absolutely Kick Ass. The Batwing that appears by the end of this movie is awesome by using to combat the Joker. When the Joker launches a deadly Smilex gas attack through balloons, Batman came in the Batwing and destroyed the balloons, angering Joker. Awesome! Batman then fired off several missiles and two mini guns, killing many henchmen but missing Joker, who in turn shot it down with one bullet from his long barreled revolver. The Joker Thugs are amazing. The main theme score by Danny Elfman was just amazing and really beautiful. I absolutely love this movie. I would never compare all other Nolan batman films with this masterpiece. Except The Dark Knight that it is the best Batman film. I will say it again this movie is AWESOME! The Batsuit designed by Costume designer Bob Ringwood who turned down the chance to work on Licence to Kill in favor of Batman was AWESOME! Ringwood found it difficult designing the Batsuit because \"the image of Batman in the comics is this huge, big six-foot-four hunk with a dimpled chin. \n\nGotham City, a big city where crime has been occurring lately and a mysterious caped crusader named Batman (Michael Keaton) is wiping streets clean of criminals, it leaves the police especially commissioner Gordon (Pat Hingle) baffled. A gangster named Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson) was dropped into a vat of chemicals which leaves him disfigures with paint-like white bleached skin and ruby-red lips plus green hair which makes him clown-like as he now calls himself Joker, he begins to terrorize the city of Gotham and stalk a sexy photographer named Vickie Vale (Kim Bassinger). Bruce Wayne who is Gotham's richest man falls in love with Vickie yet she doesn't know his true secret that he's Batman, but can Bruce deal with romance and battling with Joker at the same time?\n\nBatman is a 1989 American superhero film directed by Tim Burton and produced by Jon Peters, based on the DC Comics character of the same name. It is the first installment of Warner Bros.' initial Batman film series. The film stars Jack Nicholson, Michael Keaton in the title role, Kim Basinger, Robert Wuhl, Pat Hingle, Billy Dee Williams, Michael Gough, and Jack Palance.\n\nThe Dark Knight of Gotham City begins his war on crime with his first major enemy being the clownishly homicidal Joker.\n\nThis is definitely my favorite classic Action film from the 80's it was always my favorite childhood movie and it will always be. The action scenes are just fantastic and how Batman saves Gotham City from the Joker balloons of a deadly Smilex gas attack was amazing. Burton's Batman is my number 1 favorite film of all times and it will always be and I love it to death! 10/10 \n\nMichael Keaton will be the only Batman for me!:P.",

        "reviewText": "If you were around in summer 1989 then you'll remember that Batmania was EV-ER-Y-WHERE! You couldn't look anywhere without seeing the Bat Logo in some incarnation. The film was a mega-hit. People were queueing up around the block for hours (the literal meaning of a blockbuster). I remember being in a car, driving up Lothian Road in Edinburgh and seeing a long line of people queuing at the box office of the Cannon Cinema (as it was then) and being jealous that I wasn't old enough to see it. My lot of movies that summer was restricted to Ghostbusters II and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, both of which I saw in Florida. Batman had a 12-rating in the UK, and was upped to 15 for video. This \"grown up\" rating gave it an alluring mystique as was always the case with such movies to my hungry, impressionable mind.\n\nThe marketing team at Warner succeeded in immersing the public consciousness with the big-screen coming of the Dark Knight. Up until this point the Batman series from the 1960s is how the vast majority of the audience regarded the Batman character and universe. Tim Burton corrected all of that by giving us a dark, sinister and Gothic world with rich production design and a great score by Danny Elfman (who has made a career out of recycling the same old generic cues in nearly every movie he has scored). The original material is respected (to a degree), and the characters are deep instead of just campy. Burton also retained a lot of the noir elements that have been present in the old Batman serials and many of the comic books.\n\nMichael Keaton is the best Bruce Wayne in my opinion. He's a rich, socio-phobic megalomaniac who has more money than sense and is often bumbling and clumsy, very different from Adam West's turtleneck playboy. As Batman he's silent and imposing, the polar opposite of Christian Bale's overplayed attempt, which I don't think anyone was really impressed by. Batman needs a counterbalance and I believe that Heath Ledger helped up Bale by accident\n\nJack Nicholson is a \"good\" Joker too, not quite as iconic as Ledger's take on the character, but still a role that has defined his career. I like that they acknowledge his intelligence and gave him a new edge by making him artistically gifted, but not much is done with it when it should have been a heavier driving force behind his insanity.\n\nAnton Furst's Oscar-winning design of Gotham City is, to me, THE aesthetic that all other attempts failed to match. The smoke-blackened, cramped, and claustrophobic buildings look and create a very oppressive atmosphere, like a New York City that has not had planning permission for 200 years. The matte paintings are gorgeous and create pure escapism in a way that green screen digital mattes just cannot replicate.\n\nIt may not be as mature as Nolan's work but it has an edge that no other recent comic-book movie has. It's just a shame that the late-80s writer strike happened just a few days after Sam Hamm submitted his script to Warner. He was unable to make further drafts and rewrite scenes so Burton had some British writers make changes to the script (it was shot at Pinewood) which involved making Jack Napier/Joker the killer of Thomas and Martha Wayne. Sam Hamm was against this, as well as every single Batman fan on planet Earth. If there is one major, and valid, fault that audiences rightfully complain about then this major change to the established lore is it.\n\nRightfully a classic, and, aside from some weak writing, it's better than ALL of today's comic-book movies (please just make them stop!). If Batman had failed, then the sub-genre would be written-off forever. It's just a shame that Warner squandered this lightning in a bottle after two movies.",

        "reviewText": "No radioactive spider bites or guys turning green or supermodels painted blue here. Campy television series aside, Batman has always seemed the most serious, the most grounded, the most real of all the comic book sagas. Our hero has no magical, mystical superpowers...he's just a guy in a suit. But where does he get those wonderful toys? In this film Tim Burton does a very good job of bringing the Dark Knight to life while also seemingly giving the dark, foreboding city of Gotham a life of its own. Gotham is dark, gloomy, and dreary...almost oppressively so. The city is almost a character unto itself in the film...dark, mysterious and somehow quite real. The brilliantly conceived, stunning visuals are the perfect backdrop for the story which will unfold.\n\nThe story follows our Caped Crusader in his quest to clean up Gotham which is in the midst of a frightening crime wave. There was much unnecessary angst when comic actor Michael Keaton landed the title role with fans feeling that was a sure sign the film would lean towards the campy style evident in the famous television series. Nothing could have been further from the truth. Batman would be a serious film (well, as serious as a comic book movie can be) and Keaton was perfect in the Bruce Wayne/Batman role. Keaton's Wayne comes across as an ordinary guy doing extraordinary things. Keaton brings all the required seriousness to the role but also can add a little comic touch when necessary. Inspired casting pays off big time.\n\nGood as he is Keaton is actually overshadowed in the film. Who else but Jack Nicholson could cause the actor playing Batman to get second billing in a movie titled Batman? Nicholson's performance as the Joker is simply terrific. Maybe a little over the top at times but, hey, it's the Joker...he's supposed to be over the top. Nicholson livens up every scene he's in, he simply owns the screen. With two terrific actors doing outstanding work bringing our hero and villain to life the film can hardly go wrong. It's certainly entertaining enough but the film as a whole doesn't quite match the brilliance of the two lead performances. The supporting cast, led by Kim Basinger as the requisite love interest, doesn't add much. Instead of leaving well enough alone with a fantastic Danny Elfman score the whole movie comes to a screeching halt a couple of times while we're forced to listen to some inane Prince songs. And the story just seems to lack a certain zest. We want to see the conflict between Batman and the Joker, these two great characters played by two great actors. And for too much of the film that conflict simply isn't there. But all in all, Batman is certainly a worthy effort. Some top-notch acting, stunning visuals and a story that does just enough to draw you in and hold your attention throughout. To call this film great might be a stretch but one could say it is very, very good. Certainly good enough to be worth your while.",

He pulled off every aspect of the role perfectly ¬ñ he was better than Val Kilmer, better than George Clooney, better than everyone. He portrayed the mysterious charm of the winged crusader just as well as he captured the cool and collected character of Bruce Wayne. Michael Keaton is a huge part of the reason that this film was such a huge success, the other main portion having come from the tremendous contribution from Jack Nicholson as the Joker. Gotham City is created in incredibly detailed comic-book style, which adds to the overall quality of the movie.\n\nDirector Tim Burton does an amazing job bringing this unreal world to reality, and Kim Basinger is excellent as Vicky Vale, the film's main female presence. The script is particularly brilliant. The role of the Joker seems to have been written specifically for Jack Nicholson, which would not be surprising because of how well he pulled off the role with lines like `Why didn't anyone tell me he had one of those¬Öthings?!' and `Remember me? When you dropped me into that vat of chemicals? That wasn't easy to get over, and don't think that I didn't try.' And, of course, my favorite, `¬Öwe'll be like Beauty and the Beast. Of course, if anyone else ever calls you beast, I'll rip their lungs out.' \n\nEverything, from the setting in Gotham City to the characters costumes to the actual dialogue, gives the unreal feeling of a comic book, but the characters are developed enough so that we understand their problems and we care about what happens. The movie is a thrill ride from the beginning to the end, and is enjoyable for all ages. If anyone is going to complain about who was chosen to play Batman, there is much more room for complaint among the film's several sequels. Keaton did a spectacular job that no one has ever even come close to.",

        "reviewText": "Tim Burton takes a darker twist to a cheesy over the top silly TV show that was loved by everyone. Batman is now played by Michael Keaton. Michael as Batman was perfect, he had the look, humor, and mystery that is Batman. Playing Batman for him, he became the role and I will always stand by that. For me, he is the best Batman, no one besides the original Adam West can touch his performance.\n\nJack Nicholson is now the Joker. Who could ask for a better Joker? He has the look and dirty scary side to him that makes you fear but want to enjoy his presence on screen. He has such charisma and appeal, his lines were perfectly delivered and every scene, he stole. He and Michael were terrific together. They played off each other so well, it makes you go crazy almost. The Dark Knight vs. The Joker, the perfect super hero and villain. Jack stole my heart with his killer, no pun intended, performance.\n\nKim Bassigner was also fantastic. She plays Vicki Vale, the love interest of Bruce Wayne/Batman. She is a photo journalist who is looking for the true identity of Batman, which leads to the question of if Batman can trust another being with his darkest secret? She was absolutely beautiful and charming. No other woman could've done a better job.\n\nLike I said, Tim Burton, he takes a different turn on this \"Batman\", but it's very appealing. Everyone loves this movie, and I can't blame them. Batman is the best super hero of all comic book hero's in my opinion. You see Spider-man can fly with webs, Super Man has super strength and can fly, but Batman just needs himself. He kicks butt by himself. :) The only thing you miss in the movie is Robin, his faithful sidekick, but I don't blame Tim for not adding him for this Batman. It wasn't needed. With a cool soundtrack by Prince and and awesome setting, please watch \"Batman\", it's a true classic.\n\n10/10",

        "reviewText": "By far 1989's original \"Batman\" from director Tim Burton is without a doubt the best film made of the franchise even though it's very dark and moody. From the opening sequence when Gotham City is shown you see the backdrop as dark and the sets in many scenes featured art and odd toys. Really Burton was a mastermind at skewing one's world view with this film by using an old technique from German cinema called mis-en-scene meaning the dark mood sets the tone for a film. Clearly aside from the art and dark sets that filled the scenes of Gotham City the darkness showed in the characters especially with \"Batman\" a man with a dark past who lives in the night shadows that features a city of pain yet this is a character that is always on the side of justice. Enter Michael Keaton who in my opinion has been by far the best \"Batman\" for the way he took and showed how bottled up the character could be with sadness yet his comedic sensibility mixed well with his dark explosive style. Also Keaton showed with ease just how his alter ego Bruce Wayne could really standout as a nice and believable rich playboy. We also see \"Batman\" as such an unusual man living in a world of pain as when Wayne meets the lovely and attractive Vicki Vale(played wonderful by Kim Basinger)he on one side wants to fall in love like a normal person, but yet due to his nightly obligations of fighting crime as \"Batman\" he cannot love in a simple world. Also to add to the problem he must save Gotham from the wild and freaky \"Joker\" and he learns much about his arch rival Bruce/Batman even discovers a dark past secret a tragedy that's connected to the clown prince of crime.\n\nJust to mention \"The Joker\" who's my favorite \"Batman\" villain simply for his laughing and lovable over the top clown style of pranks and gags. But stop the press enter the granddaddy of them all that's Jack Nicholson as \"The Joker\" the guy who was the ace in \"Batman's\" deck. \"The Joker\" so evil yet so liked for his patent satanic majesty style. With Jack who's the finest and best actor in my opinion to ever live who takes each role personal and does the character over the top by doing many scenes with a different style he clearly made the character become full circle. Nicholson himself \"Considered his work as \"The Joker\" a piece of pop art. I for one like many and agree that it was one of the best performances in film history especially for a villain, now who else could have done \"The Joker\" better than Jack? Most would agree with me nobody! Overall this blockbuster is thrilling and the action is fast paced and the humor provided pumps very dark and strangely as Burton really mixed things well by making this film dark and edgy showing that the world is never normal and that the mind isn't always understood in a complex world. Yet in the end a gloomy story has a happy ending proving that he and many like \"Batman\" live on a cloud above us! Really in my opinion the best \"Batman\" film ever made due to it's darkness and secrets, the acting, direction, and writing is also top notch and the icing on the cake was applied by Nicholson's scene stealing performance as \"The Joker\" certainly one of the best in film history.",

Elsewhere crime boss Grissom's right hand man Jack Napier is trapped in a chemical factory by police.  With Batman's intervention Napier is accidentally dropped into a vat of chemical.  Considered dead he later turns up, scarred and twisted with a new sense of humour.  Calling himself the Joker he takes over the city's gangs and begins to terrorise the city. Millionaire Bruce Wayne begins  relationship with reporter Vicky Vale and finds himself personally drawn into conflict with the Joker as both himself and his alter-ego.\n\nThis was very much a huge blockbuster and had a great deal riding on it in terms of merchandising and a possible franchise.  As such Burton always seemed like a risk - although his dark toned work and complex characters probably made him a great choice.  The film starts promisingly, many questions are asked - is Wayne totally balanced?  What drives him to become the bat? etc - and the tone of the movie is darker than a friendly blockbuster.  This is continued by the investigation by reporters Vale and Knox, but starts to wane (pardon the pun) with the development of Vale as a love interest and the hamming of The Joker.  At some point the film loses the character complexities and decides to become a straight up good v's evil with plenty of effects and gadgets.  That said it's still very dark and the set pieces are well handled.  In fact it's the best of the Batman franchise so far.\n\nThe problem is that it lacks a bite for Batman fans.  I've always felt that Batman was always a few steps away from the criminals he's chasing, surely he can't be totally balanced and right in the head?  Here these questions are half touched but never developed.\n\nKeaton is an unlikely Batman, but is the best so far.  He deals well with Wayne's past when it is brought up, but is an unlikely action hero. Nicholson is pure ham, but is good for it.  He hogs all the best lines and is clearly enjoying himself - the only downside being that he regularly eclipses Keaton's Batman.  Basinger's Vale is built up far too much and should have been cut out of the story rather than become a key part of it. The rest of the cast are good and I always like to see Tracey Walters in a big screen film!\n\nOverall this is a good stab at the Batman legend.  It's dark tone gives it the feel of the comics without the characterisation, but at the end of the day it comes down to good guy v's bad guy.",

Then the Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller and The Killing Joke by Alan Moore came out and were a huge success. A movie was right around the corner.\n\nThe plot takes place in the familiar setting of Batman's home town, Gotham City. The city is all but controlled by mob boss Carl Grissom with police Commissioner Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent all but powerless to stop him. Enter the caped crusader who starts making a name for himself as Gotham's protector. He becomes the interest of journalist Vicki Vale who is determined to find out who is under the cowl.\n\nOn the opposite side of the spectrum a local thug working for Grissom, Jack Napier, encounters the Batman during a heist at a chemical plant falls into the acid. He emerges with a permanent smile and christens himself as The Joker. Joker starts to take out the other mob bosses and terrorizes the city with various deadly chemicals mixed with random every day appliances. He also gains an infatuation with Vicki Vale and constantly stalks her. Batman has to stop The Joker and save Gotham from the scum that turned him into the hero he is.\n\nThis movie captures the spirit of Batman almost perfectly. Gotham City is a huge Gothic metropolis that's unique style is something only Tim Burton could create. The casting is brilliant as well. Michael Keaton plays a perfect Batman as well as Bruce Wayne and is still one of my favorite Batmans today. Jack Nicholson was also a great choice as the Joker and manages to pull off a great blend of funny and creepy.\n\nAll though I thought a few things could've been improved, like the action scenes and the lack of character development for Gordon and Dent, this movie was a great way of bringing Batman back to the silver screen.",

It is uglier, grittier, and meaner. The style is an industrial Gothic look. It signals a departure from the upbeat Superman. And it lays the foundation for others who will come later.",

        "reviewText": "I think they took a chance on Tim Burton developing his own vision of The Caped Crusader in 1989's Batman, much like they did with Sam Raimi's Spider-Man and Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy. All gambles paid off in dividends.\n\nBatman was a phenomenal movie, in all aspects. Michael Keaton was perfect in both roles as Batman and Bruce Wayne. Jack Nicholson was also wonderful in his dual performance as the Joker and crime lord Jack Napier. The action was intense, original, exciting and inventive. The sets were masterful, the atmosphere and cinematography excellent and the mood ideal for the adaptation. Danny Elfman created and preformed his absolute best score and did to Batman as John Williams did to Superman; for the first time, both composers brought the heroes to life with a remarkable, rememberable and stunning score. The story, set-up and execution was exactly how real origin stories are supposed to be made. (On a personal note, I have little patience with movies based on characters I favor. I want to see them, and quick. I loved that they decided to show Batman up front, immediately and saved the origin story until much later as part of the mystery of Wayne. In my opinion, this was a brilliant and original move.) And Burton's vision beautifully blended in present day to the 1940's era when Batman gained popularity (yeah, I know he was originally produced in 1939.) Very little didn't work in this comic book adaptation. Namely Vicky Vale's consistent need to scream (count 'em, I believe the total number of screeching is 50+) Prince's so-so tracks and (SPOILER) I'm told that Joker didn't kill Wayne's parents in the original source. Obviously everything cannot be displayed from the comics ‚Äì we're talking 70+ years of material, and somethings have to be altered for dramatic purposes (see the enormously altered The Blind Side.) Also, only a very minute number or effects didn't work ‚Äì the only one that comes to mind is the first appearance of The Dark Knight from an above shot. It looked way too cartoonish.\n\nNone of these minor complaints constitute anything less than 5 out of 5 stars. This movie was as near perfect as either a Batman movie, adventure, comic book adaptation or good vs. evil story could be. And, personally, it meant a lot to me back in the summer of 1989 when my father took me for the first (of three) time(s) to AMC Town & Country on the Saturday after it opened in June 1989. This was a first for me ‚Äì the line was extraordinarily long and I was used to just going in and sitting down. It was also when I really started paying attention to the Box Office Reports as this was one of the biggest movies of all time, at the time. In addition, as much as I thoroughly liked the finished product, I wouldn't even appreciate it until years later when other lesser directors took their own visions on different comic book heroes. (Too many to list, but Daredevil, Hulk and any of the Punisher or Fantastic Four movies come to mind.) The plot/story was very well know, even back in 1989, but here goes: Mr. & Mrs. Zillionaire Wayne die in front of their child in an alley leaving the heir in the care of family/friend/servant Alfred. Revenge (he calls it differently, but yeah, right) fills his blood throughout his life and when able, he becomes the masked avenger bent on ridding the streets of Gotham, USA of scum.\n\nMeanwhile, mobster (#2) Jack (Nicholson) is set up by his boss, Grissom (Palance) and after inadvertently being dropped in chemicals (Batman actually did try and save him) he becomes the self-titled Joker. Revenge and power is on his mind. His short list includes: Gang takeover from Grissom, the destruction of Gotham and demise of Batman, for obvious reasons.\n\nAll at the same time, Wayne is conflicted with his vigilante's role and his new found love with Vicky Vale (Basinger.) He wants to tell her he's Batman so he can finally open up to someone other than co-conspirer Alfred, and speaking of which, in what many complain about, Alfred eventually does the deed for Wayne.\n\nJoker's also bent on romancing the lovely (and screaming) Vale, and when it's discovered she is a sore spot for Wayne/Batman, she's all the more enticing to Joker.\n\nYada, yada, yada, there's mystery, suspense, action, rescues and finally, there's the big finale and revolutions that provide an exciting finale to one of the best comic book movies ever made.\n\nThis movie hits so many demographics, including romance, comedy, action, adventure, heroism, good vs. bad, redemption that is highly recommended for all audiences. It wasn't until another visionary, Christopher Nolan's fantastic Batman Begins and the superior The Dark Knight, did anything come close to this masterpiece. And even then, neither Batman nor Batman Begins can easily be compared since they are far different takes on the classic tales. I.E. Batman was more of a fun, comic book movie whereas Batman Begins is a serious adaptation leaving the fun out the window. Both are great movies and both belong in any fan's collection. SEE IT.",

However, many years before Bale donned the famous black cowl, Michael Keaton was the 'Dark Knight.' And, believe it or not, he didn't do a bad job (at the time).\n\nAlthough, despite Keaton being reasonably well-known, top billing ‚Äì naturally ‚Äì went to Jack Nicholson as the Joker. And for a good reason ‚Äì he steals every scene. Until Ledger's final performance as the psychotic clown, no one could really see anyone else as the Batman's most infamous nemesis. Perhaps the only downside was that Jack Nicholson was given so much screen time and so many of the best lines, it's hard to see Batman as anything but a secondary character who just pops up every now and again to thwart whatever the Joker happened to be doing at the time. Despite the fact that Batman ‚Äì technically ‚Äì has wings, his character doesn't get much of an opportunity to fly. Even the fact that Bruce Wayne had a 'love interest' in the form of Kim Basinger's Vicki Vale didn't give Batman too much extra time on screen. Plus Basinger was little more than a 'damsel in distress,' screaming and gasping in bewilderment and fear almost as much as she spoke.\n\nThe 1989 vision of Batman was a smash hit, but not without its detractors. A lot of comic book fans resented the choice of director (Tim Burton) and his casting of Keaton in the titular role. Tim Burton confessed that he had never actually read a comic book (and some said it showed). However, his vision of the Dark Knight may not have been completely in keeping with its comic book roots, but it was pretty impressive. He certainly got the tone right, bringing Batman away from his 'campy' TV roots and portraying him as something much darker. Most described the outing as a 'twisted fairytale' which, although didn't reflect the source material, was a pretty accurate description.\n\nIt's safe to say that now, after Nolan's Batman trilogy, that most people consider his to be the 'definitive' Batman. However, Burton's outing/outings shouldn't be written off as anything but good. If you don't mind the villain being given more screen time than the hero, it's worth a watch alone for Nicholson's performance. Heath Ledger may be the Joker of today, but Nicholson will always be the Joker of my childhood, therefore, I give him the last laugh.\n\nhttp://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",

Director Tim Burton's Caped Crusader is a vengeful creature of the night preying on criminals who would turn his city into their personal playground.\n\nBATMAN is one stylish, thrilling and one helluva ride. While he's not generally associated with action, Burton proves it to be his forte as the Dark Knight Detective swoops out of the shadows, crashes through windows and employs a host of what his nemesis calls \"wonderful toys,\" such as grappling hook guns and the amazingly versatile Batmobile. And man on man, this Batman kicks some ass, at one point daring an armed henchman with a \"come here\" finger gesture.\n\nBATMAN wouldn't have worked nearly as well as it does without the right casting ingredients. The hiring of Michael Keaton in the lead role drew plenty of snickers, but the underrated actor showed up his detractors with a suitably mysterious performance. We know his heart is in the right place, but we're never quite sure what we should make of him. Jack Nicholson's famous performance as the villainous Joker is every bit as good as they say. Nicholson is equal parts amusing and sadistic beneath the white face paint and green hair. Sexy Kim Basinger, as reporter Vicki Vale, also makes the most out of her screen time.\n\nBATMAN is one of those films whose obvious flaws are so easily overlooked. The worst sin a movie can commit is to be dull, and that's something BATMAN never does.",

The film is brilliantly acted by its perfectly-chosen cast, which includes Jack Nicholson (the Joker), Michael Keaton (the Batman), Kim Basinger (Vicki Vale), Micheal Gough (Alfred Pennyworth), and Robert Wuhl (Alexander Knox). Tim Burton makes perfect use of his wonderful directorial talents, Anton Furst designs a Gothic, beautiful Gotham City, and Danny Elfman's classic musical score further help make this a unique, thought-provoking, and very powerful modern classic, a masterpiece of film noir and grand opera.\n\nMichael Keaton's Batman is dark, brooding, and tormented. Jack Nicholson was unforgettable as the Joker. Nicholson's joker is maniacal magic. Kim Bassinger is Vicki Vale, whose affections are pursued by both Batman and the Joker. Prince's soundtrack was awesome. the score (Danny Elfman) is well done. the costumes are great and the set design won an Oscar. Plus... all of Batman's \"wonderful toys\"... The beautifully rendered Gothic landscape that Anton Furst creates in the sets and scenery of Batman is immediately evident upon first viewing of the film. But what is probably much less evident to most viewers, is just how much Burton and his production team borrowed from German Expressionism and the silent filmmaking of first three decades of the 20th century. If this movie looks a bit stale now it's only because so many other movies have imitated it and because Burton and Elfman have become one-trick ponies. However when you look at it as the leader of a cinematic vanguard of action movies you realize how good it is.\n\nOverall rating: 9 out of 10.",

Filled with Amazing Action,Excellent performances,great direction and a brilliant score,Batman is one of my favorite movies of all time,a true classic and is Tim Burton at his best.\n\nSet in the fictional town of Gotham City,Batman tells the story of Bruce Wayne(Michael Keaton),who is a Billionaire by day,but,at night he is Batman,a masked avenger who stalks criminals and bad guys in the night gives them his own brand of justice. Now,Batman must face off against his biggest challenge yet,a psychotic criminal in clown make-up named The Joker(Jack Nicholson)who is terrorizing the city of Gotham. Now,Batman has to stop The Joker and save Gotham at any costs.\n\nBatman is a film that I have loved since I was kid and instantly made me a Batman fan,it was the first superhero and comic book film I saw and no other comic book or superhero film(although they're been plenty great and good ones since Batman's release)have had an impact on me the way Batman has. One of the reasons Batman is the greatest superhero film ever made and a classic is the way the filmmakers approach the material. Where many superhero films these days have origin stories and start at the beginning,Batman starts in the middle where we see Batman already beating up and stalking criminals at night and putting not only the criminals,but the police on edge. We don't see how Bruce Wayne became Batman,how he trains,gets the costumes or his useful weapons. It's bold move for this film not having an origin story from the beginning and starting in the middle. What I also love about this movie is the dark,Gothic style of Gotham City and timeless feel. Gotham City in this film is a dark,cynical place that's very much in the Film-Noir style,dirty streets,dark shadows,smoke,fog and harsh lighting during the night and the film also depicts Gotham City as a town where criminals roam and rule the streets. Batman was a film that brought a dark,brooding style to the superhero genre that has been imitated ever since this film was released. Where would Christopher Nolan's excellent Dark Knight Trilogy be without Tim Burton's film. The film at times has almost a timeless feel to it where you're not sure if the film takes place in the 80s,40s,50s or the 30s. It's great production design by Anton Furst adds to the film's timeless feel mixing the past,present and the future and that's one of the things I think set Batman from other superhero films. Batman and The Joker is one of the greatest rivalries in comic books,film and television and this film adds to the rivalry of this hero and villain. In the film,Batman and The Joker are at odds over the city of Gotham because Batman wants to save the city and the people,while The Joker wants to destroy the city and it's people and the battle and banter between the two characters is excellent and memorable. The Action and fight scenes are brilliant and well-done and fits with the film,because at times the Action can be violent,but also over the top and stylized. I've noticed that for years there's been a rivalry between Batman fans over whose films are better,the Burton films or the Nolan films and I don't think that's fair because Burton's and Nolan's films are different in tone and style. Burton's films are dark,Gothic and rooted in comic book style and fantasy where as Nolan's films are more gritty and grounded in reality. I love the Batman films from Burton and Nolan equally and if you're a true Batman fan you should see both as classic takes on a classic and iconic character such as Batman. The ending of Batman is classic,unforgettable and one of the greatest endings in film history and Comic Book film history and adds to the legend of Batman. An excellent conclusion to an amazing film. \n\nThe whole cast is excellent in their roles. Michael Keaton is excellent as Batman/Bruce Wayne,bringing intensity,depth and edge to the role. Jack Nicholson is brilliant and at his best as The Joker/Jack Napier with Nicholson giving a funny,maniacal and over the top greatness to the role of The Joker making The Joker One of the best villains in film history. Kim Basinger is wonderful and sexy as Vicki Vale,a photographer who is investigating Batman and is a love interest of Bruce Wayne. Robert Whul gives a fun performance as Alexander Knox,with Whul bringing humor to the role. Pat Hingle does a good job as Commissioner Jim Gordon. Billy Dee Williams does a good and smooth job as Harvey Dent. Michael Gough is wonderful as Alfred,Bruce's loyal butler and friend. Jack Palance gives a fine performance as Mob boss Carl Grissom,who is also Jack Napier's boss. Jerry Hall(Alicia),Tracey Walter(Bob The Goon),Lee Wallace(The Mayor)and William Hootkins(Lt.Eckhardt)give good performances as well.\n\nThe direction by Tim Burton is amazing with Burton constantly moving the camera and giving the film a dark,Gothic and brooding feel to it and giving the film a lot of energy and also does a great job with the Action and fight scenes. Great direction,Burton.\n\nThe score by Danny Elfman is just brilliant and it's one of my favorite movie scores of all time. Elfman's score is epic,dark,operatic and definitely fits in with the tone of the film. An excellent score from Elfman. I also loved the Prince songs that are on the soundtrack which include songs like Partyman,Scandalous,The Future,Electric Chair and Trust. Great soundtrack.\n\nIn final word,If you're a fan of Batman,Superhero films,Comic Book films or films in general,I Highly suggest you see Batman,a landmark classic in Comic Book films and Superhero films that will stand the test of time and is a film you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",

In Dark Knight, there were no tension breakers at all. I'm a tremendous Batman fan (the comic character) and during Dark Knight I felt like I was sitting through an endurance contest rather than something I'd assumed would be entertainment. Don't get me wrong, I'm not knocking Dark Knight ... it was a tremendous achievement. But the mood was very different than the original \"Batman\", and I just find that I preferred the mood of the original.",

This live action story of the comic book hero, the caped crusader, is excellent. Gotham City is high on crime, and recently people have sited an unknown creature, or maybe a man, that calls itself Batman. Michael Keaton's Batman/Bruce Wayne is the main focus. He also has really good gadgets from the Bat Cave including the Batwing and of course, the Bat Mobile. The one who steals the show is the brilliantly cast BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Jack Nicholson who falls into acid and becomes the evil Joker. The Joker is causing psychopathic incidents, such as making news reporters laugh to death. He plans to turn the city into a laughing smiling city so he and his gang can take over. Also starring Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale, Michael Gough as Alfred, Pat Hingle as Comissioner Gordon and Jack Palance as Grissom. It won the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Costume Design, Best Make Up Artist, Best Production Design, Best Sound and Best Special Effects.

        "reviewText": "I'm beyond happy that social media did not exist for Tim Burton's Batman. Could you imagine how upset - more than letters columns, fans in comic book stores angry about the film and the 50,000 protest letters sent to Warner Brothers - they would be about Batman being played by comedic actor Michael Keaton? The guy who made Pee-Wee's Big Adventure making Batman? Didn't we come so far from the Adam West Batman which people still hated and had not reevaluated in 1989?\n\nProducers Benjamin Melniker and Michael E. Uslan had purchased the film rights of Batman from DC Comics in 1979 and Uslan continued pushing the dark detective side of the character when every studio wanted camp.\n\nThis was almost made a decade earlier, as Tom Mankiewicz completed based on the comics by Steve Englehart and Marshall Rogers, who was hired to do the concept art. It never happened - at one point, William Holden was going to play James Gordon, David Niven almost was Alfred Pennyworth and Peter O'Toole would have been the Penguin -despite Joe Dante and Ivan Reitman - who wanted Bill Murray and Eddie Murphy as the Dynamic Duo - getting involved.\n\nAt this point, Batman in the comics had become a grim and gritty force of crime-fighting vengeance. The Dark Knight Returns and Batman: The Killing Joke became critical successes and despite an Englehart script that got closer, it was Sam Hamm who would take the story and make it work.\n\nIt took another Burton success with Beetlejuice to get this movie greenlit. Yes, comics were not big business in 1989. Bob Kane, who always had his name listed as Batman's creator despite Bill FInger probably doing all the work with none of the savvy to get the credit, endorsed the film in the face of disbelieving comic book fans.\n\nWith Keaton on board, the role of the Joker had plenty of potential actors attached, such as Tim Curry, Brad Dourif, Ray Liotta, James Woods, Robin Williams, David Bowie and John Lithgow. Burton wanted John Glover, which I would have loved. But the studio always wanted Jack Nicholson.\n\nComic book fans were happy with this casting. As for Nicholson, he reduced his $10 million fee to $6 million for a cut of the film's earnings and merchandise, which ended up making him around $90 million dollars.\n\nThe third star of the film would be Gotham City itself, a place designed by Anton Furst, who Burton had wanted to work with since he saw The Company of Wolves. He would later say, \"I don't think I've ever felt so naturally in tune with a director. Conceptually, spiritually, visually, or artistically. There was never any problem because we never fought over anything. Texture, attitude and feelings are what Burton is a master at.\"\n\nThe city was based on Brazil and Blade Runner, as well as the idea that Gotham was - in the words of Furst - \"what New York City might have become without a planning commission. A city run by crime, with a riot of architectural styles. An essay in ugliness. As if hell erupted through the pavement and kept on going.\"\n\nBefore Batman's release in June of 1989, a whole new wave of Batmania took over with $750 million worth of merchandise sold. I can't even explain to people not alive for that summer what it was like or the lines of people waiting to see this movie. It was incredible, levels of fandom not seen since Star Wars.\n\nFor once, in the face of so much hype, a movie delivered.\n\nGothan is on the edge of chaos, as always. Boss Grissom (a perfect Jack Palance) openly challenges the authority of the police and government. His associate Jack Napier (Nicholson) is making time with his best girl Alicia Hunt (Jerry Hall). And reporter Alexander Knox (Robert Wuhl) and photojournalist Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger) are investigating a human bat that has started destroying criminals.\n\nNapier and Batman face off at Ace Chemicals and the mobster crashes into toxic chemicals, transforming body and soul into the Joker. He takes over the mobs of the city and declares war on Gotham and Batman, who of course is Bruce Wayne (Keaton) and who has fallen for Vale.\n\nSure, it's simple in retrospect, but that's because it's become part of the fabric of our fandom. Even today I marvel at the fact that Prince did this soundtrack, that Nicholson got his buddy Tracy Walter into the role of Bob the Goon - who had his own action figure and we figured was a major new bad guy only to unceremoniously be killed off by his own boss - and that character actors like Michael Gough and Pat Hingle could so easily become who so many of us envision Alfred and Commissioner Gordon.\n\nBatman changed culture. It's why superhero movies were finally taken seriously, even if it took Marvel to finally cement that. It launched Batman the Animated Series, perhaps the greatest comic book adaption of all time, a show better than its source material. And according to Scott Mendelson, it led to an increased importance of opening weekend box office receipts, less time between movies playing in theaters and being released for home viewing which killed second-run theaters, big time merchandising tie-ins and PG-13 being the best possible rating for box office.\n\nAs for Melniker and Uslan, all their hard work really added up to nothing. Their 1992 case against Warner Brothers claimed they were \"the victims of a sinister campaign of fraud and coercion that has cheated them out of continuing involvement in the production of Batman and its sequels. We were denied proper credits, and deprived of any financial rewards for our indispensable creative contribution to the success of Batman.\" The films made $2 billion but the settlement offered by Warner Brothers to the production team was minuscule.\n\nBatman is a film that holds up for me. It was released at a magical time, my final summer at home before college, seeing my love of comic books shared on a big screen surrounded by my brother and best friend. I can still imagine it as if it were yesterday, my brother endless repeating the Joker lines we'd seen in endless trailers and commercials until the lights went down. \"Wait until they get a load of me.\"",

        "reviewText": "Batman is my favorite DC character and when it comes to movies based on the caped crusader, you guaranteed to get a slew of options. From the flashy, campy nature of the 60s movie, to the cornball, over the top manner of the Joel Schumacher films, to the dark, brilliantly animated atmosphere of the \"Timmverse\" films, Batman has had his share of makeovers throughout the years, but none can come close to the thrilling, Gothic quality of Tim Burton's 1989 masterpiece. In my opinion (light your torches), I think it is superior to Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight, and to this day, it still remains my absolute favorite Batman representation. Why else would I have a poster of the old Batman logo hanging on my bedroom wall? \n\nThe look of this film perfectly showcases Tim Burton's macabre imagination. The design of the city parallels that of the 1927 science fiction landmark Metropolis or the 1920 German expressionist film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. It's one of my favorite looks for a city and it's a pity they didn't use the stylized, dark look of the city for Schumacher's films. I also admire the film's overall tone and feeling. Even though it's a Batman film (the first in a series), it still feels like a Tim Burton film, and Burton does a good job of re-imagining Batman as if he was his own creation rather than Bob Kane's. He treats Batsy with love and affection and of course comic book nuts will get all over the film for not following the source material closely, but this one still has it where it counts. In this film, the characters come first, and this film has some of the best you will ever see grace the screen. \n\nMichael Keaton very well might be my favorite Batman. Sure, the animated series Batman (voiced by Kevin Conroy) was excellent and Christian Bale is okay with his dark, raspy voice, but Keaton proves that you can be a calm, collective Batman yet still be threatening and terrifying at the same time. He goes around in the cape and cowl smirking and giving off menacing grins to thugs and you can really tell that he enjoys playing the role. It's shocking that people thought he wasn't a good choice to play the dark hero. I thought he was spot on, really fit for the role. He did play Beetlejuice after all! \n\nAll the other players are fantastic as well. Jack Nicholson's Joker is scary and funny as heck and with a permanent grin on his face, he really gives you the shivers. Like Keaton, you can really tell he enjoys playing the villainous clown prince of crime. He's always what I imagined the Joker being like in movie form, equipped with dangerous laughing gas and chattering teeth! I also like Billy Dee Williams, Kim Basinger, Pat Hingle and Michael Gough in their respective roles, and who could forget Danny Elfman's top notch score mixed in with those catchy, late 80s Prince songs. \n\nBatman is a great movie, and the impetus that led to other superhero films being made. I like to think that one day, Tim Burton will make another Batman flick, but I'm not holding my breath. Hopefully, somewhere down the road, a Batman reboot will come along that not only mixes in the contemporary nature of the comics and the Nolan films, but the dark, demented and overpowering nature of the Burton films. It would make for quite a Batman we have never seen before.",

        "reviewText": "The only reason why I didn't give this a 10, was that the film itself is a bit too long. But putting that discrepancy aside, this is still a solid and sophisticated film, that is undoubtedly one of Tim Burton's better film efforts along with Edward Scissorhands and Corpse Bride.\n\nThe cinematography was spellbinding. The view of Gotham City from the air was brilliantly shot and very well realised. The music by Danny Elfman perfectly matched the cinematography, as that was outstanding. I also liked the mixture of darkness and tragedy wrought into the characters, as is so typical of Burton.\n\nAs for the acting, that was equally outstanding. I couldn't think of a better cast for this type of film. Michael Keaten was suitably brooding as Batman, and Kim Basinger matched him wonderfully in an innocent but sophisticated role as Vicki Vale. However, it is Jack Nicolson's mind-blowing performance as the rather sadistic joker that holds this film together. If I have to decide who was better as the joker between Jack Nicolson and Heath Ledger, it would be an extremely close call, but Jack Nicolson for me. He was both scary and comical, which reminded me of Tim Curry's(who was 2nd choice for the role of the Joker) Pennywise in It.\n\nThe direction by Burton was tight, and he assured us that the high-tension of this film rarely slipped. In conclusion, a must-see if you love sophisticated and dark films, with a touch of edge, because this film has plenty of that. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox",

        "reviewText": "A+ I remember seeing this film as I child and once the credits rolled, all I could say was \"WOW\". They had done it. Mind you I was born in 1992, so I became a Batman fan due to the Kevin Conroy original series and so forth. I had always wondered what a Batman film would look like. Not those camp filled crap fest with Adam West. That's not how Bob Kane had envisioned the characters at all. Instead, it is Tim Burton who breathes life into my favorite character.\n\nIt all starts out with a spectacular cast. Michael Keaton is perfect as Bruce Wayne, portraying a tormented soul that was still heroic to the audiences. Thanks to Michael Gough we are able to connect deeply with him even more so. Kim Basinger did quite well, while Robert Wuhl is our comic relief somewhat but I enjoyed him in it. The talent of Keaton is nearly outdone by Jack Nicholson as Joker. His role defines psychotic, a twisted homicidal \"artist\" as he puts it quite often. Though he displays many of the cartoon and comic book weapons, the darkness and insanity the character gives off still makes you feel an aura of dread while in his presence, such a volatile being really. I give kudos to both this Joker and Heath Ledger's; I guess the latter might be more suited to today's realist movie goers.\n\nThe story is definitely Batman at his darkest, yet enjoyably comical at times. Burton sets up a grim atmosphere with remarkable sets and nicely done lighting. Pacing is never off in this movie as well. One of the main reasons the movie really works is just that Batman is embodied so perfectly. Danny Elfman is a damn genius; the score is beautiful and thrilling. It cements the both heroic and dark moments, as well as the tragic. The flashback scene where Bruce remembers them murder of his parents was mysterious and daunting, downright exhilarating and full of terror.\n\nYou see, despite the spectacular re-makes, this film will always be remembered for what it inarguably is: and that is a one-of-a-kind take on Batman that is a dam classic.",

        "reviewText": "Tim Burton's Batman may still reign supreme when it comes to offering the most gothic version of Gotham on film but apart from that, everything about it feels a bit outdated. There are definitely darker elements at play but much of it is ruined by its goofy antics, lame action & terribly dated effects.\n\nInfusing a dark tone & creating an eerie atmosphere in a story is one thing Burton excels at and it only works out in this film's favour. But the decision to retain a bit of camp is also why it looks a bit cartoonish today. Production design team leaves a lasting impression but other aspects are more or less mediocre.\n\nDanny Elfman's soundtrack is another highlight, and his iconic theme for Batman still remains untouched. Michael Keaton's rendition of Bruce Wayne is interesting, Jack Nicholson sure has more fun playing the Joker but he also goes overboard at times, and the rest of the cast & characters they play are mostly forgettable.\n\nOverall, Batman is very much a product of its time that hasn't aged well over the years but it will still surprise those who are more than capable of looking past its decaying visuals. After all, the drama is engaging, the action is in abundance, and both its set pieces & music continue to impress even today. It's just too cartoonish for me.",

        "reviewText": "This Tim Burton movie is about the darkest superhero movie that had been created to date. Despite deconstructing the hero and making him a bit of a dangerous loony, the film exudes quality throughout. The sets are incredible with their detail and darkness, the acting is top-notch and the script is generally great, except when they diverge into irrelevant flashback scenes that do NOTHING to improve the story.\n\nBruce Wayne is a complicated guy. Yes, he's rich and fights crime, but he's on the edge. Vicki Vale is a hot reporter who is apparently not mentally ill but also has no real purpose in the movie but to get saved by Batman. The Joker is a total nut-case--but a fun to watch nut-case, as he struts and preens while he dispenses evil.\n\nHe is by far the best character in the film, as Jack Nicholson seems to have a lot of fun. Some of the most awfully violent but amusing images were the Joker's joy buzzer as well as the effects of Joker Brand cosmetics on its victims (two dead ladies make postmortem appearances in one of the Joker's ads on TV endorsing the products!). In addition, I loved the scene where the Joker and his men trash an art museum--spray painting and smashing artwork with abandon. That is until they get to the painting \"The Scream\"--Joker tells his men to leave that one alone--\"Now that I like\".\n\nAside from the dumb back story, I liked all of the movie--even the violent things Joker did that I listed above. HOWEVER, I was appalled that the movie was marketed so strongly to kids, as this was NOT a kids' film. My wife and I saw a guy in the theater with his two year-old! The kid, naturally, screamed through much of the movie!! For adults, it's a wonderful film--but for kids under 12 or so, no way--it's just too dark and violent.",

None of the sequels come close to topping this one for great fun. The plot: Batman tries to save Gotham City from the outrageous villain Joker. Michael Keaton is terrific as Batman/Bruce Wayne; Kim Basinger shines as the beautifully seductive reporter Vicki Vale; and Jack Nicholson gives arguably the craziest performance of his career as the Joker. Directed by Tim Burton, \"Batman\" is one of the best looking movies that I've ever seen. The Oscar-winning production design is eyepopping and mindboggling. I love movies that have production design that takes you to a world like no other seen before (like Ridley Scott's \"Blade Runner\"). The Gotham City look in this movie is unforgetable. The special effects and music score (by Burton regular Danny Elfman) are superb too. \"Batman\" is great fun from start to finish. And boy do I love that Joker's laugh!

      "text": "In a back alley of Gotham, a tourist family is mugged, and the mother and son threatened. Shortly thereafter, the crooks who swiped the husband's wallet are accosted by a costumed vigilante, that resembles a giant bat. The vigilante tells one of the crooks to tell his friends about him. When the crook pleads to know 'what' this creature is, the costumed man replies, \"I'm Batman.\"\n\nWhen the two crooks are found by the Police, Lt. Eckhardt shows up at the scene, dismissing their description of a man dressed up like a bat. However, the crime scene is soon found by Alexander Knox, a reported for Gotham City's newspaper, who has been following the 'bat attacks.' Knox has so far counted 8 sightings in under a month, and asks Eckhardt if it's true that Police Commissioner Gordon has opened a file. Eckhardt just dismisses the 'oddball' reporter.\n\nMeanwhile, the Mayor of Gotham City has held a press conference, introducing the city's new District Attorney, Harvey Dent. Harvey promises to clean up Gotham, and make it a place for respectable people once again. This press conference comes just weeks before the 200th Anniversary Gala celebrating the birth of Gotham City.\n\nBack at the Gotham newspaper, Knox meets one of the paper's new photographers, Vicki Vale. Knox is mildly interested in her, but then grows even moreso when she tells of her interest in trying to find out who Batman is. Knowing that Commissioner Gordon has a file on this vigilante, Knox intends to get into a charity benefit at Millionaire Bruce Wayne's mansion, where Gordon will be attending. Vale also decides to accompany him.\n\nMob boss Carl Grissom is angered at the persistence of Harvey Dent, figuring that the new District Attorney could find out about their connection to the Axis Chemicals plant. One of Carl's men, Jack Napier, nonchalantly suggests they break in and steal the files that could incriminate them. Carl takes to this idea, and recommends that Jack is the man for the job. Jack is reluctant, but Carl insists, calling him his \"number one guy.\" What Jack doesn't know is that he's about to set up to be killed, as Carl has learned via Eckhardt that Jack has been sleeping with Carl's mistress Alicia.\n\nMeanwhile, at the charity benefit, Knox attempts to get information from Gordon, but fails, with the Commissioner denying that there is a Batman on the streets. Vicki, meanwhile, meets up with Bruce Wayne, who seems a little shy. Bruce eventually excuses himself when his butler Alfred requests his presence. In a secret command center, Bruce reviews video footage of the party, and catches Gordon talking to an associate, who has received a tip that Jack Napier is going to Axis Chemicals to 'clean it out.' Lt Eckhardt is handling taking care of him, but Gordon goes there to take charge.\n\nAt Axis Chemicals, Napier's men find the plant's safe...only to find the documents they came for are gone. Suspecting a setup, Jack cautions his men to watch out. Shortly thereafter, they are ambushed by Eckhardt and his officers. Gordon shows up shortly after the gunfire, and demands that Jack Napier be taken alive. During the chase, Jack kills Eckhardt as revenge for double-crossing him. Batman eventually corners Napier, and catches him just before he falls into a vat of chemicals. However, Batman lets go, and Jack falls in. Gordon sees Batman, and orders him to halt, but the Caped Crusader gets away. Gordon then instructs his men not to mention what they saw.\n\nThe next day, Napier's death is ruled as a suicide, but Knox suspects that Batman ended up taking care of Grissom's man. Knox asks Vicki to help him further investigate the case, but she blows him off, saying she has a date with Bruce Wayne.\n\nIn reality, Napier has managed to survive, and makes his way to a seedy doctor to have his face repaired. However, the chemicals he fell into have permanently bleached his skin white, and turned his hair green. As well, his face seems frozen in a permanent grin. Jack then returns to Grissom's penthouse, having concluded that he had Eckhardt tip off the cops, and that Carl set him up to die. Revealing his newly-changed face, Jack claims to now be The Joker, and kills Grissom.\n\nMeanwhile, Vicki and Bruce share a rather quiet evening in Wayne Manor. While Vicki is rather intrigued by Bruce, she finds that the large Manor does not seem to reflect much on him. When she invites him to an outing, he declines, saying he has to leave town for certain reasons.\n\nBack in the criminal underworld, the Joker asserts control of Grissom's operation, claiming that Grissom has gone away for awhile, and has left him in charge. Claiming to oversee all of Grissom's affairs, the other crime bosses are not convinced, and still fail to acknowledge this, even when the Joker electrocutes one naysayer, Antoine Fortelli, in front of them.\n\nMeanwhile, Vicki grows curious about Bruce, and follows him as he leaves his mansion. Though he said he was leaving town, she finds him staying close to Gotham. Following from a distance, Vicki sees him walk into an alley, and lay two roses on the pavement. She soon after calls Knox, asking to find any information regarding the street location.\n\nEventually, one of the crime lords, Vinnie Ricorso, attempts to go public, holding a press conference saying that Grissom has left him and his associates (not including the Joker) control of Grissom's empire. It is then that the Joker appears, and stabs the crime lord in the throat, before driving off.\n\nDuring the press conference, the Joker dispatched his own henchman, Bob, to snap pictures of people there. One of them is of Vicki Vale, whom the Joker soon grows infatuated with.\n\nAlso of interest to the Joker is the Axis Chemicals plant. Using a combination of dangerous chemicals, the Joker creates a chemical known as 'Smilex.' Combined with any normal household product, it causes a person to die of laughter, leaving a permanent grin on the victim's face. Because of this, the public stops using any form of beauty and hygiene products, as so far, no one knows what is causing this.\n\nShortly after this, Vicki Vale receives a request from Bruce Wayne to meet him at the Gotham Museum of Art. When she gets there, she finds a table reserved, and receives a gift box containing a gas mask. Within seconds, the museum begins filling with sleeping gas. Vicki puts on the mask, only to see the Joker (flesh-tone makeup covering his white complexion) enter, and vandalize the art pieces before sitting at her table. It soon becomes apparent that the invitation was sent by him, for a rather twisted romantic evening for two for them.\n\nSuddenly, Batman swoops in through the skylight, and makes off with Vale. The Joker's goons give chase, following the Batmobile through Gotham. When traffic blocks their way, Batman and Vicki get out and run away on foot. Batman eventually distracts the goons, while Vicki finds a hiding place. During his confrontation, a couple bullets hit Batman's chest and he goes down.\n\nAs the goons examine the body, one begins to remove the Batman's mask. Vicki attempts to snap a picture of his identity, but her flash catches the goon's attention. This gives Batman time to take them out, before summoning the Batmobile, and both he and Vicki head to the Batcave.\n\nOnce there, Batman reveals that he has found the source of the 'smilex' drug, and gives Vicki the information to take to the press. However, before she can ask more questions, she blacks out, and finds herself in her apartment...minus the film in her camera from the previous night. Noting the time and the file that Batman gave her, Vicki calls Knox, and the 'smilex' information makes the front page, and puts Batman at the forefront of the people's minds, including the Joker.\n\nBruce soon after pays Vicki a visit, and she angrily reprimands him for lying to her about leaving town. Bruce tries to explain more about who he is, but their conversation is interrupted when the Joker appears. Bruce attempts to threaten the madman, to which the Joker asks him a question: \"Ever dance with the devil in the pale moon light?\" Bruce is offput by this, but has almost no time to react as the Joker shoots him. Vicki watches as he and his men leave, but when she returns to Bruce's body in the next room, she finds it gone, with a silver serving tray with a bullet in it (Bruce was wearing this under his shirt as protection when the Joker shot him).\n\nAfter this ordeal, Vicki returns to the newspaper, where Knox reveals the information he found regarding the street where Bruce was. According to the newspaper, this was the area where Bruce's parents were gunned down by an unknown gunman. Vicki soon begins to realize a bit more about Bruce through this.\n\nMeanwhile, the Mayor and his aides hold a press conference to cancel the 200th anniversary gala for Gotham. However, their broadcast is interrupted by the Joker, who declares that Carl Grissom is dead, and that he is in charge of the crime syndicate in the city. Much to the delight of the common people, the Joker announces that a party will be held that night, with $20million in cash given out to the crowd, and promising that Batman will also appear.\n\nBruce has been watching the entire event unfold, and thinks back to the words that the Joker had said. The night his parents were murdered, the man who gunned them down also used the 'dance with the devil' line, and Bruce is certain that the Joker killed his parents. It is then that Vicki appears in the Batcave, having been let in by Alfred. Bruce tries to admit his feelings for her, but knows that there's little time for words, given what the Joker is planning.\n\nBatman first sends the Batmobile to Axis Chemicals, in hopes of blowing up all of the Joker's activities. While he destroys the facility, the Joker is not in the building at the time.\n\nShortly thereafter, several giant balloons and floats make their way down the streets of Gotham, with the Joker playing music and giving away free money. Batman appears soon after, flying his Batwing plane. When the Joker sees this, he and his men put on gas masks, and let loose smilex gas in canisters attached to the balloons.\n\nBatman shortly thereafter swoops in, and flies off with the balloons, saving most of the citizens. Once he has let them go, he returns in an attempt to take out the Joker. The Joker has other plans, and takes out the Batwing with one shot of a comically long pistol. The Batwing crashes, and Vicki (who was nearby covering the parade for the newspaper), rushes to the cockpit, only to find noone there.\n\nIt is then that she is accosted by the Joker, and taken up to the top of a nearby cathedral. Batman follows shortly afterward, just as the Gotham Police arrive and lock down the building. However, they are unable to ascend the stairs when the Joker uses an acid flower to cause one of the cathedral's bells to drop down and destroy the wooden stairway.\n\nAt the top of the tower, Batman confronts the Joker, blaming him for the death of his parents. However, before Batman can properly take care of the Joker, the clown ends up two-timing both Batman and Vicki, and soon the two are dangling from the top of the cathedral.\n\nShortly thereafter, the Joker's helicopter appears, and the Joker attempts to get away. However, Batman uses a grappling hook that gets entangled on the Joker's leg, and on a stone gargoyle. The weight of the gargoyle ends up causing the Joker to fall to his death.\n\nIn the aftermath of the ordeal, The Joker's men are captured, and it appears that Gotham is now safe. Batman has also sent a signal to the Gotham Police, to use if they ever need to call on him. Specifically, it's a large spotlight with a replica of Batman's chest symbol on the lens, which shines into the sky to summon Batman.\n\nMeanwhile, Knox is surprised that Vicki isn't covering the event, and that she seems to have given up on trying to find out more about the Batman. As she walks away, she is greeted by Alfred, who is there to escort her to Wayne Manor, with the caveat that Mr Wayne will be 'a little late.' Meanwhile, Wayne is on the rooftops of Gotham as Batman, contemplating the Batsignal and still waging his war on evil."

        "reviewText": "Batman Returns is a perfect film to watch during the holiday season as the winter/Christmas atmosphere that Burton creates for Gotham City is wonderful. It's weird that Warner decided to release this as a summer film. It doesn't fit.\n\nWhat's even weirder, when you consider the content of this film, is that it was aimed at families. An upper-class couple throws their mutant baby down the sewer, a socio-phobic billionaire dresses up in leather as a flying rodent, a lonely secretary has a mental breakdown and dresses up in leather as a feline, and said grown-up mutant baby freak runs for political office while being backed by a Trump-like business tycoon hungry for more power. Not to mention the S&M subtext that Tim Burton somehow managed to get away with. His eccentric visual style fits this film best, and is the height of his career, IMO. This is Tim Burton at his Tim Burtoniest.\n\nThis is a true live-action incarnation of the comic-book character and Burton really should have stayed with the series to keep it on the correct course before it crashed and burned. Batman Returns is not as grown-up and straight-faced as the Dark Knight, but it's more atmospheric, and I just prefer the oddball character development here and Nolan's movies took themselves very, VERY seriously, almost to a fault. They are often depressing to watch while Burton's approach, and the animated series that it inspired, continues to resonate and find new fans.\n\nDarker and more violent than the first movie, the sense of Gothic pathos reaches a new high. I was quite keen on Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne, he displayed the right balance of weirdo loner and cool crime fighter. Michelle Pfieffer is amazing as Catwoman (much sexier and more 'realistically' cat-like), she wears that leather outfit better than the embarrassment of Anne Hathaway, who was simply appalling. Danny DeVito is so convincing as the Penguin that his scenes become a little disturbing to watch. Special mention must be made of Christopher Walken, who is brilliant as the spooky Max Shreck if you think you recognize his Chip Shrek it's none other than Butterfinger from Hudson Hawk (fitting, as co-writer Daniel Waters is the man responsible for turning that movie from an adventure heist into an absurdist comedy).\n\nSam Hamm returns to pen the screenplay, this time without being restricted (and sabotaged) by writers strike deadlines and it's a stronger film with a better assortment of characters, chemistry, and dialogue. He even manages to get in a subtle dig at the shortcomings of the rewritten 1989 screenplay by criticising Alfred for letting Vicki Vale into the Batcave - something Alfred would never do but was necessary for fixing structure problems.\n\nDanny Elfman's score is also even better than it was first time round. His powerful and engaging themes define the Batman universe better than any other composer. No offense to Hans Zimmer, who made some wonderful stuff for Nolan's movies, but Elfman gave Batman a sonic aura that became world renowned and it will always be THE defining Batman sound. This movie is the Batman phenomenon at its Zenith. Stick to the animated series and forget the following sequels. Christopher Nolan brought integrity back to the series, but before Schumacher destroyed it, Burton gave the original series integrity too and I miss this twisted fairy tale incarnation of the character.\n\nAn essential Christmas film, and my favorite Batman adventure.",

We have terrific actors and a great plot with the dark knight and two new villains, Catwoman and The Penguin. We have Michael Keaton back as Batman and he's still awesome than ever. Michelle Pfieffer, the perfect choice for Catwoman and was perfectly cast into place. As much as I love and is such an incredible actress Annette Benning, she couldn't have been Catwoman, she doesn't really have the look. Danny DeVito, who could have imagined him as The Penguin? He was just great and terrifying! \n\nBatman returns with a more loving community of Gotham City, they are celebrating Christmas time with, Max Shrek played by a creepy Christopher Walken. The perfect villain who mistreats his lovely secretary, Selina who happens to hear too much at his office causing him to push her out the window in hopes that she dies and will never reveal the information of knowing the Penguin and the attempt to make him loved in Gotham. When she survives and is awakened by cats, she wants revenge and is ready to go at it with her cats! But there is also another active villain, The Penguin who is in search of his parents that abandoned him and now he is looking to be the new mayor of Gotham City! Can Batman be able to stop both super villains from creating their hanous acts and stop the mayor from destroying the city as well?\n\nYou'll have to see! Batman Returns is just as good as the original Batman, despite the first one remaining the true classic, this one still takes you for a ride. And come on, I mean we've got Michelle in leather! Her classic moment of just meeting Batman and The Penguin \"Meow\" is classic! There are memorable characters, lines, and sets! You'll have a blast! Trust me! \n\n9/10",

        "reviewText": "One of the darker films ever made. It is one of my personal favorite Batman movies. Batman Returns is dark, violent and a worthy sequel to the 1989 Batman. Danny DeVito gave a brilliant performance as The Penguin. The only two good things in this movie are return of Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne/Batman and Danny DeVito as The Penguin. I thought classic original Batman (1989) was way better film than this. Batman Returns is my second favorite Batman film in the franchise. The film has a many problems in here I didn't like and it annoys me, but there are other things I did like and love in the second installment.\n\nThings I don't like in this film: Michelle Pfeiffer as Selina Kyle/ Catwoman she was extremely violent woman. I still couldn't believe how could an grown aged woman act like a child, trying to be an animal and than she just rip off a harmless pet rubber animals stuff them in a sinker , destroying a doll house, spraying a t-shirt and than acting that she is the queen in this movie? She wasn't written and portrayed by the comic books like was Anne Hathaway in The Dark Knight Rises. Selina Kyle was never a secretary like she was in Shreck Company, she wasn't a vigilante, violent or angry woman. She was a cat burglar and a thief. She didn't went around cutting people like she did in this film, she only did what was necessary to do for survival. That is the main problem in this film. I still prefer and think Kim Basinger is much better better actress than Michelle Pfeifer is and I still love Vicky Vale much better than Selina Kyle. Sorry Bat fans. I wish there wouldn't be Max Shreck in this film because he look's like a selfish lunatic person. Those are the main problems I don't like in this film, that is why this movie is not better than his superior predecessor. \n\nThings I do like in this film:\n\nThe Action sequences are outstanding and awesome and Fight sequences are fantastic. The first fight between Batman and Catwoman is awesome. The film is very dark which I love that in the film. Michael Keaton reprise his role back as Bruce Wayne/Batman. It is my childhood film and I will always watch it. It was a big hit in 1992 when the film come out, there were different times then, than they are today. The story centers around Christmas Eve. The Penguin, releases several bats that fly frantically around the girl's (Ice Princess) head, causing her to lose her balance and fall, but giving the impression that Batman, visible to the crowd below, had pushed her. She lands on the tree switch, lighting it up and unleashing a flurry of bats that the Penguin had hidden within the branches. Batman attempts to flee. I love that Batman flees in this film around Bats flying the crowd. It shows his symbol stands for Bat which he is a Batman. He also try to save that girl when she was kidnapped but couldn't. The Penquin and Catwoman becomes alley and they set up Batman to be a criminal. I love how The Penguin had placed a control device under the car that let he himself steer it from an arcade-style car hidden in a trailer. Batman, helpless, is trapped behind the wheel of the Batmobile as it veers through the streets, knocking over city property and frightening citizens. Batman manages to remove the control device before anyone is killed, and returns home. That is the best awesome scene I have seen. Batskiboat using in this film that batman drives on the sewer was FANTASTIC! Beside Batmobil there was other vehicle used in this film. Batman saving all the children from Penquin was also awesome. Batman was a real hero in this film. There was no Robin in here. Which I am happy about it. Batman does not need any sidekick to help him out. I hate Robin, don't get me wrong I don't like that character and I never did. \n\nMichael Keaton Is excellent as Bruce Wayne/Batman his acting performance to me in both Burton films is better than Christian Bale is. Michael Keaton's Bruce Wayne was a clearly uncomfortable man, a mumbling solitary eccentric, ill at ease in his own skin and with other people. In the Batsuit, though, he becomes the beast he really is, an imposing personification of vengeance and fear, despite his slighter frame. There's something far more sympathetic about Keaton's Bruce Wayne. Maybe it's because he was never recorded throwing a wobbler on set. Tim Burton did a great job directing and producing the second Batman film. I love the costume designer by Bo Welch for Catwoman, Batman and Penquin. J. P. Morgan's wardrobe was used for inspiration on Max Shreck's costume design. I think those three actors Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito and Michelle Pfeifer did a great character chemistry and good acting performance. CGI was also not bad for the bats I real love it. I love this film not as much as I love The Dark Knight and Batman but I still love it. \n\nThe rating I give to this film is 10/10. Anything under 7 would be ridiculous, as anyone claiming this isn't at least a GOOD action film.",

        "reviewText": "There were a lot of things that were excellent about this movie, like the cinematography and the performances, though it isn't as good as the first film. Michael Keaten is suitably brooding as the Dark Knight, better than George Clooney in Batman and Robin (considered as the worst out the franchise)though he is overshadowed by the villains, namely Danny DeVito as the Penguin, who looked as though he was having a ball, and brought a sense of sadness and grotesquesness to the role. Christopher Walken was effective also as Max Schrek. Stealing the show, with her flawless delivery of not-so special lines, is Michelle Pfeiffer as the sexy and manipulative Catwoman. The film looks lovely, with the sets and effects, and Tim Burton directs with detail. However the film does drag, and while there are some intelligent lines from the villains, the script could have been developed a little more. All in all, a dark and entertaining film. Whereas Batman Forever is funnier and more fast paced, Batman Returns is darker, but just lacks the sophistication of the first film. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",

        "reviewText": "The caped crusader, or dark knight whatever you call him has returned to Gotham City. Michael Keaton is back as Batman in this sequel to the 1989 original with the same director Tim Burton (Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street). Unfortunately most of the best lines are stolen by the villains. Danny DeVito dominates the film as the evil Penguin who is trying to learn his past and change his future, while at the same time framing Batman. There is also the appearance of Michelle Pfeiffer as the curvaceous and mysterious Catwoman. Also plotting to take over the city with the help of the Penguin is the popular Christopher Walken. Also starring Pat Hingle as Comissioner Gordon, Michael Gough as Alfred and Vincent Schiavelli as Organ Grinder. An interesting sequel, not as much magic like the original and a bit darker, but still a very good classic. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Visual Effects and Best Makeup, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Make Up Artist and Best Special Effects. Batman was number 46 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, and he was number 84 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!",

        "reviewText": "Tim Burton returns to direct the second Batman movie. Evil businessman Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) intends to build a 'powerplant' that does nothing but help himself. Danny DeVito plays The Penguin who was abandoned as a baby and now lives in the sewer. Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) is the timid assistant to Max Shreck until she discovers his evil plans. He pushes her out the window, and she turns into Catwoman.\n\nThe Penguin is no Joker. He really isn't anything that could be deemed superior to the Joker. The good thing is that they put in Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman. She is much better than all the screaming from Kim Basinger. And the movie still has that Tim Burton style. All in all, it's almost as good as the first Batman movie. The best thing here is Michelle Pfeiffer. Who could ever forget Michelle cleaning herself?",

        "reviewText": "This sequel proves that Tim Burton was for all intents and purposes THE best choice to ever direct a Batman movie. The story focuses on Baman taking on three enemies: The Penguin (wonderfully played by Danny DeVito) Catwoman (the slinky Michelle Pfeiffer) and Max Shreck (the superb Christopher Walken).\n\nPerhaps the best entry in the series, it has it all: complex themes, complex characters and a dark tone that truly stands out. The cast is simply wonderful although the obvious stand-out is DeVito as the multi-layered Penguin. Here is a guy who is evil, pitiable, funny and perhaps most importantly, scary. The infamous scene with Shreck's image consultants still sends shivers up my spine. In other words, the cast is simply a joy to watch and all turn in first rate performances.\n\nI do not hesitate to say that \"Batman Returns\" is my favorite of all the Batmans released (sorry, Dark Knight fans). If you want a superhero film that has a little more to offer besides flashy effects and big scale action, then please check out this badly underrated film. \n\nIf nothing else, it's at least the best film Tim Burton has ever made.",

        "reviewText": "I really wanted to be able to give this film a 10. I've long thought it was my favorite of the four modern live-action Batman films to date (and maybe it still will be--I have yet to watch the Schumacher films again). I'm also starting to become concerned about whether I'm somehow subconsciously being contrarian. You see, I always liked the Schumacher films. As far as I can remember, they were either 9s or 10s to me. But the conventional wisdom is that the two Tim Burton directed films are far superior. I had serious problems with the first Burton Batman this time around--I ended up giving it a 7--and apologize as I might, I just couldn't help feel that Batman Returns just has too many small direction, plot and script problems scattered throughout to justify a 10.\n\nBut Burton _almost_ trumps the problems with sheer force of style, and even though there are a lot of small flaws, Batman Returns is still a great film, especially if you're a Burton fan, as Batman Returns has just as much in common with The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) and Edward Scissorhands (1990) as it does with anything else in the Batman universe.\n\nThe film begins strongly, with the Cobblepots having a baby. We see their dismay--people walk out of the birthing room with horror on their faces, ready to vomit. Later, they have the baby in a small cage. Finally they take it out for an evening stroll and dump it in the Gotham City River. The baby ends up becoming Batman villain The Penguin (Danny DeVito).\n\nMeanwhile, Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) is the film's \"evil capitalist\", comparable to Grissom (Jack Palance) in Batman. He is planning on duping Gotham City in various ways, and we see him emotionally abusing his secretary, the timid Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer). When Kyle discovers one of the nefarious plots, Grissom tries to get rid of her, but she is rescued by cats, becoming Catwoman.\n\nWhile all of this is going on, The Penguin, who has long been only rumored to exist and who is thought to be dangerous, begins a scheme to be presented to the public as a good guy, despite having less than benevolent, ulterior motives.\n\nBefore re-watching Burton's Batman films this time, I didn't remember just how little the films are about Batman (Michael Keaton). It's almost as if Burton didn't feel the character was interesting enough to focus on. The focus here is much more on the villains, especially The Penguin. Batman doesn't appear very often, especially in the beginning of the film, and surprisingly often, we're watching him watching The Penguin.\n\nAlthough some viewers necessarily count the above as a flaw, I can't say that I do, even if I'd like to know more about Batman and follow his story more. The villains' stories are interesting, too, and as an \"origin story\" for two major Batman villains, Batman Returns is already more than complex in terms of plot.\n\nHowever, there are some character problems that I do count as a flaw. The Penguin has a cadre of circus performers who do his bidding, but even though they're frequently on screen, we never get to learn anything about them. Burton has a core of characters as intriguing as those in Tod Browning's Freaks (1932) available, with actors as interesting as Vincent Schiavelli, but he just doesn't have the space to use them.\n\nFor that matter, he hardly has space to explore Catwoman. The film plays as if Catwoman may have been as developed and featured in as many scenes as The Penguin, but that cut of the film would have been 4 hours long. So the bulk of the Catwoman scenes had to be excised. Of course, all of this barely leaves any room for Batman. Burton has Batman turn very dark in the public's eye in this film, and unusually, he never bothers to resolve this. As far as we know, at the end, Gothamites still think that Batman is a murdering lunatic. That's an interesting development, but unfortunately it ended up being dropped between this film and the next.\n\nAs for the script, although there are minor problems including some non-sequiturs and bizarre decisions (in terms of logic) made by characters, it's clear that Burton and writers Sam Hamm and Daniel Waters are not exactly trying to tell a traditional story. A lot of the dialogue is pun-oriented, but often this is fairly subtle and/or complex (of course, sometimes it is very blatant or transparent, too). It helps to look at Batman Returns as a more \"poetic\" film, as I believe was the intention. This also carries over into more general plot and directorial decisions--plenty of odd character actions, including from minor characters, are done in service of a general mood or style, and that style works very well.\n\n\"Dark\" is the easiest way to sum up Batman Returns in a word, and whether that's a positive or negative depends on your disposition. Anyone who knows me knows that I love dark. So for me, Burton's style largely transcends the flaws in the plot and the script. In many ways, Batman Returns is like an insane, campy horror film, with beautifully eerie production design. Like Batman, Burton is still making many references to other films, but instead of Vertigo (1958) and Star Wars (1977) (well, there's still a slight Star Wars reference), he invokes films like Nosferatu (1922) (including that \"Max Schreck\" was the name of the actor who played the Dracula-like character there), Motel Hell (1980), the aforementioned Freaks, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971) (which has a surreal, dark edge to it) and zombie films--made most explicit in The Penguin's final scene.\n\nIn terms of visuals and general atmosphere--and that includes the general \"feel\" of the story, the characters and so on--this couldn't be a stronger 10.",

        "reviewText": "Tim Burton's Batman Returns is my second favourite Batman movie thus far. It's pretty underrated, stylishly cheeky and full of ornate, wonderfully oppressive, melancholic set design and drips with a Gothic sensability that only Burton included in his versions, and seems to be missing from the franchise these days. It's dark, comical and just a little bit campy, always a winning combination. Michael Keaton steps back into the batsuit for a second time, and he's even more somber and downbeat than in Burton's original 1989 film. Keaton is so talented, and one only needs to look at his zany work in Beetlejuice and compare it to the heft and restraint he shows as the caped crusader to see this. Here he's faced with a snowy, blackened and endlessly corrupt Gotham City, this time under siege from three wildly different villains. Danny Devito plays Oswald Cobblepot, a.k.a. The Penguin, in what is probably the most outlandish character in the otherwise grim film. He's a bad tempered, knobbly little gremlin, encased in sallow makeup and sporting disgusting, pasty little flippers. It's hard to tell it's even Devito at all until that little smart ass mouth opens up to hurl calculated obscenities at anyone and everyone. He aims to be mayor, and only in freaky deaky Gotham would a plan like that ever be taken seriously, from a sewer dwelling, animalistic mobster with an army of clowns following him. Christopher Walken plays evil, ghoulish Max Schreck, an amoral monster of a businessman with nefarious plans of his own, and a haircut that would make Andy Warhol run for cover. Last and most memorable is Michelle Pfeiffer as Selina Kyle, Schreck's awkward, meek secretary who eventually becomes Catwoman. And what a Catwoman she is. Forget Anne Hathaway, Julie Newmar take a number, and we won't even mention Halle Berry. No one played the pussy quite like Pfeiffer. She's got a shiny, skin tight outfit with the body to match, a sassy, sexy attitude, a whip smart mouth on her and just a hint of psychosis, making her my favourite film incarnation of the character. \"Meow\" she purrs sensually as an incendiary bomb detonates behind her. Damn. They all get wrapped up in various schemes and scams. Penguin wants ultimate power, which apparently involves kidnapping a bunch of infants. Schreck wants ruthless progress to tear Old Gotham up in worship of the almighty dollar, and Catwoman is content to slash and burn everyone's plans, until she gets a bit of a smolder in her eye for Batman, providing some electric sexual tension between the two of them that's a highlight of the film. Neither of them are sure whether they want to kiss or kill, fight or fcvck the other, and it's devilishly entertaining watching them hash out their hormones in naughty little action sequences and slow, slinky intimate scenes, involving both Bruce and Selina as well as their feral alter egos. Their chemistry revolves at the center of the piece, with all manner of circus sideshow madness happening around them. Pat Hingle and Michael Gough diligently put in work as Commissioner Gordon and Alfred Pennyworth, with Doug Jones, Michael Murphy, Andrew Bryarniarski and Paul Reubens rounding out the roster. Burton outdid himself with style on this one, his trademark eye for loving detail laboriously employed here to the point where it surpasses the artistry of a comic book and starts to look like some mad dream of Vincent Price. He dipped his toe in the water of the Batman universe with his first outing. Here he plunges headlong into it and fully commits to a style and tone that's distilled to a satisfactory point that he wasn't quite at with Batman 1989. A treasure in the franchise, and a wicked fun film at that.",

The former is just one-dimensional, lame and unconvincing.\n\n\n\n* \"Batman Returns\" manages to capture the essence of Gotham City -- the atmosphere is magnificently portrayed (dreary, dark, depressing), which is more than I can say for TDKR, which tries very hard, but fails.\n\n\n\n* I did kind of enjoy Bane in TDKR, but his character was severely under-developed and there was not much of a story behind the whole residing-in-the-sewers-for-years stuff. The Penguin in \"Batman Returns\" is well explained, the story revolves around the sewers, and a lot of the action takes places there.\n\n\n\n* The costumes / the makeup alone are reason enough to see \"Batman Returns\" -- amazingly good! In TDKR, there's ABSOLUTELY nothing -- everyone (including Batman) look like they're wearing cheaply-made, lame Halloween costumes from one of those 1$ stores.\n\n\n\n* The lead characters are well-developed and colourful -- even the supporting/minor characters. In TDKR, they are one-dimensional, bland, mostly unlikeable, and you just don't care for them much.\n\n\nI liked Christian Bale's Batman a bit better than Keaton's, though. The worst one, without a doubt, was Clooney's.",

Michael Keaton returns as Batman / Bruce Wayne for his second and last time and I could not have think of anyone else. The rest of the actors are really cool and the film is just amazingly well done.\n\nThe visuals, music, editing, story and pacing are very good in this film and I am very pleased with the final results, but it was not that dark and violent. Overall, BATMAN RETURNS gets an 10 out of 10, while there are some flaws, I still love this movie.",

Although it is much violent and darker, this is the Batman that creator Bob Kane envisioned many years ago.  Michael Keaton reprises his role as the avenger of Gotham City. This time he's up against two deadly foes, Danny Devito's Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman.  With a great cast and film score by Danny Elfman, the movie takes us on an adventure as Batman battles the evil forces that are trying to take over Gotham City.  Christopher Walken makes a great appearance as Max Shrek, a shrewd businessman who has an evil scheme up his sleeve.  But of course, Michelle Pfeiffer is the one that steals the show. With all of these components, you have a film that will blow you away. This is the reason why you go to the movies.  It's got everything.  It's really a shame that Tim Burton didn't get to direct the other sequels.  If so I think the franchise would still be going strong today.  Batman Returns is an awesome experience for fans that like cool movies.",

The cats and pegiun scenes are so horrible. The film practically starts over and forgets its first installment other than one brief convo mid film. Using clowns as penguins' henchmen was so off cue after Joker was the villian in the last film. Pengiun was kinda bad but not terrible. Max Shreck was unrealistic no emotion too. As in the first installment, Michael Keaton does well and tries his best but he doesnt have the Bruce Wayne look, doesnt retain Batman's character values and acts very choppy as Batman. He even kills people in both films. Tim Burton just didnt understand the Batman Character. He also doesnt understand Catwoman. She literally steals nothing in this film that is her thing to steal things! The Batman car wiring scene is so bad and makes no sense. The film adds a new unnessacary sexual dialogue. So many problems with the film. I did like the cobblepot max shreck villain plan. Good James Gordon and good Alfred renditions.",

        "reviewText": "I'm not gonna lie, for a while I was a bit down on Tim Burton's own sequel of his 1989 classic post-modern adaptation of the the dark knight. It was mostly in due to feeling that the script was weak, with dialog WAY over the top, and an overall appeal that just at times seemed either too serious for its own good or too hokey (I mean, penguins doing what they do in their final moments in the film, who'd of thunk). But seeing the film years later, as Batman Begins now has its mark in the comic-book world, I've found a greater appreciation for it and Burton's vision. It's actually one of the best of the franchise, a given to be better than the Schumacher films, but with an added appeal after seeing countless other films since taking this is as a kid.\n\nEven as it isn't necessarily great, it has brilliant things about it, from its lavish and spooky production design (hell of a way to make that Penguin lair), fantastic make-up, and twists that have a perverse fascination here and there as a blockbuster entertainment. I'm also very fond of the performances I see again. Keaton still has that deadpan style as Batman that works (even if he's lesser as Bruce Wayne); Pfieffer is the best that could be done with Catwoman; De Vito stand out and occasionally steals scenes as Oswald Cobblepot (his plight is almost the most poetically tragic of the series, however if not the best as a villain); Christopher Walken is, well Christopher Walken in one of the lesser of the over-the-top roles he's done.\n\nBut maybe most of all that has me gravitating more to Batman Returns as one of the better sequels of the 90's is how much of Burton's vision makes it to the screen, and how his control over the material is present throughout very strongly, as the sense of humor is either very dark or just very silly (in a good way, \"My Babies!\" Penguin cries out looking on at his confused penguins). And Danny Elfman's music is one of his best, at being at times eerily somber but with that Gothic edge the material needs. Plus, Burton understands a slight 'camp' element to what the Batman world might have, but doesn't overplay it like Schumacher did. In short, it's really just good entertainment that is maybe even more appealing after seeing all of Burton's films and, in general, just seeing more movies and understanding sloppy vs. successful in these hugely produced franchise pieces.",

        "reviewText": "I've enjoyed this movie ever since I was a kid and I still do. I also liked Batman forever back then but the real difference is that THIS movie didn't date when I grew up. I did notice a few scenes in this film that didn't make any sense like: 'Hhmm... the crowd is angry. Hey! Where did they get those tomatoes from?' Then I thought: 'who cares? This movie is not 100% serious anyway!'\n\nThe original Tim Burton Batman was great as well but it was a bit cheesy at some parts and I didn't like all the actors. This movie improved on almost every aspect with a wonderful cast, a more Gothic style and no involvement of Prince. \n\nNowadays, many fans of the Christopher Nolan movies dislike Burton claiming that the Nolan movies are more serious and therefore more loyal to the comics. I don't think this is entirely true: -There has never been an adaptation of the original concept of Batman which was a vengeful criminal killer with a gun. -Batman has taken many forms over the years peeking its silliness in the 60's (and a bit with Batman & Robin). A director is free to choose what kind of Batman he's going to portray as long if it's good.\n\nMy opinion: Batman doesn't necessarily have to be serious. It's about a man in a rubber suit with pointy ears. Burton managed to create a perfect balance between the silliness and the darkness surrounding the whole idea.\n\nI just recently watched the Nolan movies and I love those ones as well (especially The Dark Knight). There's simply something about this movie that interests me more. Nolan's goal was to give the character much more depth and in doing so, he looked for an explanation of nearly every aspect of Batman. That's a bit too much for me, I'm a bigger fan of the more abstract version of Batman. The Burton movies are more theatrical and centered around the atmosphere.\n\nMy conclusion is that you shouldn't compare the Nolan with the Burton movies. They're just different and it's up to you to decide which one you like better. My respect is for both directors.",

        "reviewText": "Spoilers herein.\n\nWhat Burton brings to the table is a quirky design sensibility. All other elements of his films are conventional Hollywoodisms. But when he hits a sweet spot with that situational and production design, it works. At least it works as a voyage to another planet.\n\nHis first Batman film was a disaster in this respect: it visually lacked both imagination and control. He knew he screwed up, and this time he fixes nearly everything that was broken the first time around. He still has that dead melodramatic third act, but everything else is great.\n\nThe city bears some similarities to the Gotham of the first, but he lives in this one. It has a perverted life, rather than the carcass of the first. He literally places his camera among architectural elements of the city this time. The batcave is completely reinvented to be more jagged, dark and schizophrenic. The contrasting ice cave really does contrast: it has light and color and movement and life of a twisted sort. The chemical factory and cathedral of the first was just a set of large props.\n\nSomeone paid attention: the `world' of the city is blunt industrial, an anti `Metropolis,' largely broken. Michelle's apartment is modeled after the building in Welle's Kafka movie I think. (You can visit that building today.) The cave has organic roughness, a completely different world altogether. This craftily sets the `two-world' theme of Bruce's mind in which we presume this all happens. But the clever introduction of a third design consciousness is what makes this really fly. \n\nThe ice cave is part sewer and part 1964 New York World's Fair. The structural elements here are so radically different in conception that I can only think that three different talents created these three architectural notions. (Incidentally, we saw these structural elements revived in the recent interiors of the ice cave in `Die Another Day.') Keaton does change character depending on the forces of the surrounding built space. This is a fantasy that perhaps only an architect could appreciate: a visual drama of dual forces within the mind.\n\nEven Elfman's honking is better. The `girl' in this one participates in the split world dynamics as well. Very clever writing, this. Michelle's architecture is what she wears, which is another element of the genius in the art design. The problem is that something happened -- I do not know what -- and the effect was messed up at the end when they changed the costume all around. This was in the days when Michelle still had something to offer, and because I have hit her hard on some other films, have to note some informed work here. Most of the body acting is by doubles of course, but her face shots in costume use a knowing device: in `real' life, she acts with her eyes and as Catwoman, she acts with her mouth. \n\nThat mouth is borrowed from Helena Bonham-Carter. (In fact, when a film actress makes something work, many lessor actresses appropriate it. Its part of the game, and one can have some fun with Michelle's later films guessing who she's imitating.) \n\nDeVito is one of our most intelligent actors. Not as an actor, but in his understanding of reflexive notions in humor: his `Momma' was based on Nabokov! As with the Joker before, he's just a disgusting prop here.\n\nEsther Cobblepot is a redhead.\n\nTed's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.",

        "reviewText": "Batman Returns came at a time when Tim Burton and Danny Elfman had become a superstar team and forgot what landed them there. Whereas films like Pee Wee's Big Adventure and Beetlejuice had lots of over-the-top set pieces, surreal themes and bounding music, they also had a lot of good heart, charm, fresh ideas and fun storylines.\n\nBatman Returns is pure style over substance, and the style isn't even pleasant to look at or listen to. It's dirty, gritty and alienating. None of Batman's gadgets or action scenes feel exciting, inventive or original, and yet they're presented as if they were. You often feel like you're missing something, but no, there just isn't much there once you strip away the surrealist style and bombastic sounds.\n\nIn contrast to Nicholsan's Joker, there's zero charisma in DeVito's Penguin nor Michelle Pfieffer's Catwoman. And in the latter's case, her looks, which are covered up most of the time, can't save her.\n\nSpeaking of sound, Danny Elfman shows zero restraint and just can't help but cram his bombastic soundtrack into your ears even when nothing on the screen warrants it. It quickly wears you out and you occasionally feel the need to cover your ears just to get a break from it. The opening score is suitably epic and memorable, and that's not the problem. It's in the music score throughout the rest. Every single little thing elicits these overly loud baritone romps that stop being a soundtrack and instead become rather obvious attempts to make the audience pay attention to the soundtrack more than the film itself. At least in the first Batman, Elfman's score gets a break during Prince's music tracks. Not so, here. It's non-stop and over-saturated, and your ears will beg for it to stop.\n\nWhile Burton and Elfman are trying to one-up each other - Burton with visual style and Elfman with music - Burton forgot he was actually supposed to tell a story and have compelling characters. His self-indulgence tanks the entire film. It doesn't work as an action film and it doesn't work as a stylistic film. It just sucks. And because it's so loud, you can't just close your eyes and tune it out to feel like you got your money's worth. It won't let you.\n\nI worked at a movie theater when Batman Returns was in theaters, and the very best part of it is the song Face to Face by Siouxsie and the Banshees which plays during the closing credits. It's the only time in the whole experience of this movie you don't feel like it's trying to blast you out of the theater with its visuals and obnoxious soundtrack. I remember people exiting the theater looking tired and disoriented, feeling like they were supposed to like what they just watched, but confused about why they didn't.\n\nBatman Returns was a box office success, but critical viewers knew it was not a great film and you can only make so many of those before the audience will turn on you. I don't think Burton made another film that truly follows up his earlier work until Big Fish in 2003. Burton and Elfman are the classic example of great talents that need a steady and restraining hand for them to perform at their best.",

        "reviewText": "For a long time, this was my favorite of the Batman films. It had the best cinematography and an edgy feel to it with two wild characters - Catwomen and The Penguin - along with the always-interesting Christopher Walken. However, after the last viewing it finally slipped in my ratings and, frankly, I now prefer the last Batman: Batman Begins, with Christian Bale.\n\nTHE GOOD - Nonetheless, this is still the most intriguing of the five latter-day Batman films. The stylish cinematography in here is the best of any of the Batman movies. Director Tim Burton is known for his films which feature stunning visuals, as this is a great example. The three characters listed above are all very different and very interesting, almost fascinating. Of the villains, I preferred Catwomen, finding her the most fun to watch before and after she changed. Violence is not overdone here as it was in several of the other Batman stories but one is never bored watching this. As he did in the first film, Michael Keaton does a fine job playing Batman/Bruce Wayne.\n\nTHE BAD - For a movie based on a comic strip that mostly kids read, I still think these first two Batman movies, both done by Burton, were too dark and the profanity was definitely not appropriate. Although, unlike the first movie, there was no usage of the Lord's name in vain in here, there still was profanity and both villains made too many sexual remarks. That would have been okay if they hadn't marketed this film for kids as well as adults. Danny DeVito's \"Penguin\" is downright gross in spots. \"Grotesque\" I can handle, but who wants \"gross.\" Few guys, meanwhile, complained about the beautiful Michelle Pfeiffer playing Catwoman. Generall too much darkness and some cheap shots on Christian- bashing also made me re-consider my previously-high rating of this film.\n\nOVERALL - Fabulous visuals and memorable characters make this the most interesting in the Batman series, but too-dark an edge, too gross and too much anti-religious bias all finally turned me off after a half-dozen looks at this film. Sorry, but I prefer a kinder-gentler Batman movie. After all, it's just a cartoon. Most will disagree, but I was glad to see the series lighten up after this one.",

Here he was raised by penguins and now as an adult he wants to return and find out who he really is. Meanwhile businessman Max Shreck is pressuring the mayor to allow him to build a new power plant for Gotham. Shreck is due to turn on the city's Christmas lights but the ceremony is interrupted by a nightmarish group of clowns and acrobats and Shreck is captured by their leader; Cobblepot, who is now known as The Penguin. He knows Shreck's dark secrets and blackmails him into helping him become a respected citizen. He isn't the only person to learn Shreck's secret; his timid secretary learns one too but he pushes her through a window. She doesn't die but she is changed¬Ö less timid and somewhat demented she makes herself a masked costume and becomes the Cat Woman. Of course it will be up to Batman to deal with these threats and ultimately make an unlikely alliance to save Gotham.\n\nThe previous film in the franchise may have been dark compared to the '60s TV series but it still had a fair degree of camp¬Ö this is much darker and to my mind better. Danny DeVito's Penguin is a vile creature; physically repulsive but also bitter and rather perverse. Christopher Walken is suitably wicked as Shreck as he manages to stay just the right side of becoming a pantomime villain. Michelle Pfeiffer is suitably sexy and confident as Cat Woman in a delightfully kinky costume as well as being believable as the timid Selina. Michael Keaton is also impressive as he returns in the role of Batman. The story itself is decent although it mainly serves to deliver a variety of enjoyable set-pieces where the bad guys to bad things and Batman tries to stop then. The dark tone and general nastiness of some of the characters means it won't be suitable for younger viewers but I'd still recommend it to older Batman fans.",

        "reviewText": "Tim Burton the man behind the original Batman film and Beetlejuice, brings the world the sequel to Batman, that exceeds the original in more ways than one. Firstly Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny De Vito are a great mix of Batmans enemies. The dark, deadly and sexy Catwoman works well to rattle some heads within the story and penguin works in the same way that the joker worked in the original. The sets are stunning and immaculate. Gotham city has so many dark alleyways that you could never know what's happening at one time or another. The only thing that gives it a bad name is its script, which at times seems to lapse and then not recover for while. Tim Burtons direction bring superhero films into a new realm. Beats all the superman films and the other Batman films by a mile. Though in terms of realisation the new Batman begins has a bite where this one lacks, but Burton is a more original director than Nolan.\n\n*First review written by me at 16. Re-written at 21*\n\nTim Burton has an interesting history in film, between the surreal Pee Wee's Big Adventure and mis-interpreted Alice in Wonderland, Tim Burton's career has gone from an artistic darkly comic director, to unimaginative copy-cat of his own work. I still stand by my original review in that this film is very cleverly directed, beautifully shot, with stunning towering set pieces, but a script that goes from cheesy melodrama, to cheap and nasty humour. \n\nThough with some terribly written scenes there are some, incredible ones. Mainly those concerning antagonists Catwoman and Penguin. One scene in particular concerning the two concocting a frivolous ploy to destroy batman is one that springs to mind. The acting is first class, Danny DeVito is deliciously theatrical and sinister, Michelle Pfeiffer relentlessly sexy and smooth. \n\nSince my original review Dark Knight was released. Unfortunately for Burton I retract my youthful statement of his originality over Nolan. Dark Knight surpasses Batman Returns and almost eclipses its existence, but this instalment still has great merit and will stand out as one of the greatest superhero films, not to mention cementing Batman as the greatest superhero franchise ever.",

The story was an interesting one and Danny Devito, Christopher Walken and Micheal Keaton gave great performances. Plus lets face it, Tim Burton was a genius and did the comic book character more justice than Joel Screwmacher ever did.\n\nPlot: Oswald Cobblepot also know as The Penguin(played By Danny Devito) is abandoned by his parents as child for being deformed. He uses this as an excuse to masquerade a sinister plot to abduct the first born children of Gotham with the help of his goons(Red Triangle Gang) and a very shady tycoon Max Shreck(played by Christopher Walken). Max Shreck later makes Penguin the mayor of Gotham. Selina Kyle(Michelle Pfeiffer) is pushed out of a window by Max Shreck and is revived by cats. Later on she develops cat-like qualities and seeks to destroy Max Shreck and Batman. Her reasons for wanting to destroy the dark knight are not explained.\n\nOpinion: Batman Returns is a classic. It has a darker feel in terms of atmosphere. Tim Burton always had a knack for making grim backgrounds look appealing. Micheal Keaton is still sharp as Batman. Danny Devito steals the show as Oswald Cobblepot/The Penguin. When you think about it, he would have made a better Violator for the movie Spawn than John Leguizamo. Michelle Pfeiffer gave Catwoman more personality than Halle Berry ever could. Max Shreck is one of Christopher Walken's best roles. The main reason why I like Batman Returns is that its fun. Its not only creative but its also fun. Something a lot of big budget movies these days sorely lack. The Batman series goes to the dogs after Tim Burton decided to do no more. You don't believe me, look at Batman Forever and Batman and Robin. Thank god that Christopher Nolan breathed life back into the series with Batman Begins.",

They say it has elements of S&M but I really don't find anything of that sort except for Catwoman's whip.\n\nThis movie is deeper than its genre and villains aren't just some crazy freaks dressed like on a masquerade. They have strong motives with strong feelings involved. Catwoman (a great performance by Michelle Pfeifer!) isn't just a sexy chick who likes steeling jewels - she's on her personal crusade and Pinguin... well, by the end of the movie you really feel sorry for him (strong performance by Danny DeVito). Again, I think Michael Keaton is the best Batman and he carries his costume well.\n\nYou can totally see that it is a Tim Burton movie, because he has an unusual style and is a very talented guy. But also the music is fantastic and fits the emotions.",

        "reviewText": "There has been a rush of comic book films lately that have garnered high praise, but what everyone seems to be forgetting is that, over a decade ago, Tim Burton made a film that is easily on par with the best comic book adaptations being made today; maybe even better. The film is, of course, Batman Returns; which can only be described as an all out comic book masterpiece. Quite frankly, everything that could be good about this film; is great. Tim Burton has succeeded on a number of levels to bring us the ultimate comic book movie - the characters, the plot, the atmosphere - everything in this film is right on cue. What really annoyed me about the first Batman film was that Burton didn't seem to know where he wanted the focus. It seemed as if he wanted it to be more on The Joker, but then he threw in some character building for Batman; and the final result was very messy. This has been sorted out for this film, and although it has once again left Batman in the shadows; Burton has given us two great villains to have fun with, and the fact that the focus is more on them only makes the film better.\n\nThe plot mainly follows a young child that was dumped into the sewers at birth. This child would grow up to become 'The Penguin', and he chooses to rise from the sewers at around the same time that businessman Max Schrek has decided to throw his secretary, Selina Kyle out of the window; who then becomes her alter ego, Catwoman. The Penguin and Max Schrek then team up so that the former can get his revenge on Gotham City, and, of course, the caped crusader is on hand to dispatch the baddies. The plot isn't all that deep or intelligent, but it serves it's purpose and allows Tim Burton to do what he really wanted to do with the movie; create a very dark Gothic look for Gotham City! Batman's home town looks absolutely fabulous throughout this film, and the winter setting blends magnificently with Burton's Gothic architecture to create a world that excellently compliment's it's hero's dark personality, while creating a great aesthetic playground for Burton to weave his tale within.\n\nIt's not just the atmosphere that makes this film what it is - a plethora of great performances have been added into the mix, with each performer giving great energy and enthusiasm to their roles. Michael Keaton returns to his role as the caped crusader, and pretty much does what he did in the last film. He's never really given a chance to impress, as his three villainous counterparts constantly upstage him. Danny DeVito is supremely grotesque in his role as The Penguin, and makes sure that he holds the focus in every scene he's in. This sort of role suits an actor like DeVito excellently, and this is the best I've ever seen him. On the flip side to The Penguin, we have Catwoman; who is played by the very sexy Michele Pfifer. She looks great in her black leather suit, and her demented portrayal as the tortured villain works brilliantly. Rounding off the cast is the magnificent Christopher Walken. Walken has an uncanny ability of making a huge impression in everything he's in, and his dark and downbeat portrayal as a shrewd businessman is just great.\n\nOn the whole, I highly recommend this film to everyone. While the substance isn't always there, Burton has given this sequel enough style and enough entertainment value to more than adequately mask that fact and if you're a fan of cinema; I see no reason to dislike this film.",

        "reviewText": "Batman Returns (1992)\n\nI've seen this version of Batman a few times now, over the years, and in many ways it's the best of them all, along with the companion 1989 \"Batman.\" And in some key ways, both of these fall just short of quite gelling into classics.\n\nHere's why, both ways.\n\nFirst, remembering Batman as a comic book hero, Tim Burton's version of that world is wonderfully exaggerated and fanciful and actually comic. This is the biggest difference (in my humble view) with the Nolan films of the last decade. Where Burton sees a chance to be inventive and playful, Nolan sees a chance to make the unbelievable real.\n\nIt's a relief that there is no reality to Burton's world. Sometimes you can tell the movie was shot on a set‚Äîand the same set, rather a lot‚Äîbut that's again part of the \"world\" we are drawn into.\n\nCharacters for Burton are about excess just beyond camp. The Penguin is pretty amazing‚ÄîDanny DeVito pulls it off like no one else could, an equal to Jack Nicholson's Joker from Burton's earlier Batman flick. And Catwoman as played by Michelle Pfeiffer is terrific. Batman himself might be a matter of taste‚Äîmany people prefer Michael Keaton but I find him dull. And in this movie, he mostly stands around as Bruce Wayne and drives around as Batman. Not much physicality here.\n\nChristopher Walken? He starts off being weird and wonderful and then kind of keeps that steady state attitude throughout (even as his world is in constant tumult). It works, but it's not perfect. In fact that's what happens a lot of the time. Some of the \"action\" sequences aren't as elegantly edited (or shot) as other similar films (especially Nolan's) and so there is energy but not necessarily a visceral involvement. (You have to be thinking about this while watching it, I suppose.)\n\nBut it's Burton's idea of Gotham, and his development of characters, that makes the movie really special. Whatever its limitations, it has so much that goes beyond expectations‚Äîand beyond the somber grandiosity of the Nolan versions‚Äîyou really need to see it.",

      "text": "Wealthy new parents Tucker and Esther Cobblepot (Paul Reubens and Diane Salinger) are burdened with a deformed and violent infant son. One snowy night, they dispose of him by tossing him, concealed in a basket, into a stream. The basket floats down through Gotham City's sewers and eventually arrives at the underground penguin habitat at the Gotham City Zoo, which had been out of business for some time.\n\n Thirty-three years later, Gotham is preparing festivities for the Christmas season. Max Shreck (Christopher Walken), the corrupt owner of a company whose factories emit a dangerous amount of toxic waste, is nonetheless a celebrated local figurehead. Shreck joins the Mayor (Michael Murphy) at a city gathering to make a short speech, but a gang of grotesque circus performers descends upon the crowd. They attempt to kidnap Shreck, but the sudden arrival of Gotham's trusted hero Batman (Michael Keaton) sends them scurrying away.\n\nSoon afterward, the circus gang manages to capture Shreck when he is alone in a dark alley. They take him through the sewers to the lair of their leader, the mysterious Penguin (Danny DeVito), who is the hideous Cobblepot child now spending his adulthood in the abandoned zoo where his basket had landed so many years before. The Penguin attempts to blackmail Shreck by threatening to expose his underhanded business dealings to the citizens of Gotham. Having no knowledge of his past life or true identity, Penguin sees Shreck as a potential vehicle for a chance to live on the surface and be accepted by others, thus giving him the freedom to track down his family. Shreck reluctantly agrees to work with the Penguin.\n\nShreck's awkward and overworked secretary, Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer), lives a lonely single life in a small apartment, with her only regular company being an alley cat who comes through the window every night for a saucer of milk. While working after-hours in the office, she accidentally stumbles across proof of Shreck's crooked business schemes. Shreck arrives and, despite Selina posing no blackmailing threat, attempts to kill her by pushing her out the window. She falls several stories into the alley below, but is strangely resurrected when a swarm of stray cats surrounds her. In a daze, she returns home and trashes her apartment. She makes a skin-tight black catsuit from an old jacket and attaches metal claws to her fingertips, thus reinventing herself as \"Catwoman.\"\n\n Meanwhile, the Penguin prepares to make his entrance into society. During a press conference, a circus gang member appears and snatches the Mayor's infant son from his mother's arms. After the gang member disappears down a manhole, the Penguin rises to the surface holding the unharmed baby. The setup turns the Penguin into a local hero, and he wins the respect of citizens and city officials alike. Shreck still acts as the Penguin's main adviser, and grants him access to the Hall of Records to search for information about his birth parents. The Penguin rifles through piles of birth certificates and composes a long list of names. He then ventures to a cemetery, flanked by reporters, and lays a flower on the grave of Tucker and Esther Cobblepot. He reveals that his birth-name is Oswald. The Penguin becomes a news sensation and a respected celebrity. Only Bruce Wayne (Batman) is suspicious, believing there is more to the Penguin's motives. With the help of his trusted butler Alfred (Michael Gough), Bruce investigates the Penguin's background and discovers that he had once been a member of a freak show in the Red Triangle Circus Group. On several locations at which the circus stopped for shows, children had mysteriously gone missing.\n\nTaking the Penguin's respectability a step further, Shreck plans to have the current mayor impeached and replaced with \"Oswald Cobblepot.\" Though the Penguin does not take kindly to image consultants, he relishes his rise to power. The circus gang uses setups to convince the public that the current mayor is unfit for office, resulting in even more support for the Penguin.\n\nBruce Wayne and Selina Kyle had met, in their usual identities, during a meeting with Shreck. There is a mutual attraction, but neither expects the other of leading a double life. At night, as their alter egos, they encounter each other after Catwoman blows up a Shreck department store. They eventually have a violent fight, ending in Catwoman being thrown off a tall building into a truck full of kitty litter.\n\nSelina, as Catwoman, meets with the Penguin in an attempt to use his political power to get revenge on Batman. The Penguin agrees, clearly harboring intense lust for Catwoman, and they concoct a plan to frame Batman as a villain and turn all of Gotham against him.\n\nThe plan unfolds on the night of the ceremonial Christmas tree lighting in the city square. A beauty queen known as the \"Ice Princess\" is in her dressing room, preparing for her duty of pushing the button to light the tree. The Penguin confronts her, posing as a talent scout, before injuring her with a bat-shaped throwing knife and kidnapping her. Bruce Wayne, meanwhile, had invited Selina Kyle to his mansion for dinner that evening. Their romance intensifies, but when they see the news of the Ice Princess kidnapping on TV they hastily make excuses to leave. Batman hunts for the missing woman, finding her alive and bound in a tall building overlooking the town square. Before he can release her, Catwoman appears and drags the girl to the edge of the building. The Penguin, out of sight, releases several bats that fly frantically around the girl's head, causing her to lose her balance and fall, but giving the impression that Batman, visible to the crowd below, had pushed her. She lands on the tree switch, lighting it up and unleashing a flurry of bats that the Penguin had hidden within the branches. Batman attempts to flee in his famous Batmobile, but the Penguin had placed a control device under the car that let he himself steer it from an arcade-style car hidden in a trailer. Batman, helpless, is trapped behind the wheel of the Batmobile as it veers through the streets, knocking over city property and frightening citizens. Batman manages to remove the control device before anyone is killed, and returns home.\n\nThough satisfied with the sullying of Batman's reputation, Catwoman becomes an enemy of the Penguin's by refusing his sexual advances. He hooks her on one of his many trick umbrellas, which becomes a propeller that hoists her above the city and drops her through a greenhouse roof. She survives death yet again, as she acquired nine lives upon her transformation.\n\nThe next day, the penguin holds a press conference, deriding the mayor for not providing sufficient protection against the allegedly dangerous Batman. Bruce Wayne and Alfred, however, manage to undo the Penguin's sterling reputation by playing through loudspeakers a recording of a recent anti-Gotham rant that the Penguin had delivered to Batman. The crowd turns on the Penguin and he escapes to the sewers once more. Furious, the Penguin denounces any ties to humanity and reveals to his gang his true reason for visiting the Hall of Records: to collect the names of all the wealthy first-born sons in the city, which the gang will then kidnap and murder while their parents are away at Max Shreck's elaborate Christmas party. The Penguin sees this as revenge against his own parents for discarding their own first-born son in such a callous way. His main target is Shreck's grown son, Chip.\n\nBruce and Selina attend the Christmas party, and soon realize their respective identities. Before they can leave, the Penguin appears and announces to all in attendance that their children are being kidnapped as he speaks, and chastises them for leaving their children unguarded so their parents could \"dress up like jerks, get juiced, and dance badly.\" He attempts to kidnap Chip Shreck, but Max offers himself in his son's place. Realizing that his real beef is with Max, the Penguin agrees and the two return to the underground lair.\n\nBatman springs into action, attempting to stop the Penguin's plan. The Penguin resorts to his back-up idea of equipping his army of penguins with missiles and mind-control devices, and sending them into the streets to \"punish all of Gotham's children.\"\n\nBatman manages to direct the suicide-bomber penguins back to the zoo lair to destroy the Penguin rather than the city. Batman confronts the irate Penguin, who attempts to attack him with a sword-umbrella, but falls into the toxic water below his lair.\n\nShreck attempts to escape the lair but is intercepted by Catwoman, bent on revenge to her abusive former boss. Batman attempts to convince her to let Max live to be sent to prison, but after Max shoots her several times, taking away most of her remaining lives, she electrocutes him with a live power line and a taser. An electrical explosion occurs, during which Catwoman disappears.\n\nThe Penguin emerges from the water, fatally hurt from the toxins he ingested while submerged. Before he can pick up his deadly umbrella and kill Batman, he collapses and dies. Six penguins drag the body into the water, creating a grisly funeral scene.\n\n Some time later, Bruce is being driven home in his limo by Alfred. He sees what appears to be Catwoman's shadow playing across an alley wall. After leaving the car to investigate, Bruce finds only a small gray cat. Returning to the car with the cat, both Butler and Master wish each other a Merry Christmas. The bat-signal appears overhead, and Catwoman appears, proof that Selina still has one remaining life."

        "reviewText": "I saw this movie upon it's release in 1997 I was just six years old and honestly I loved it so much I even had a Batman & Robin movie poster in my room that I got for attending the movies opening day. I got the movie on VHS for my birthday after it was released and I watched it pretty much every weekend at least twice but now that the movie is over twenty years old and I'm an adult with much better taste in movies I thought I'd watch the movie again on Blu Ray and give a review on my nostalgic experience and see if my opinion on the movie has changed much over the years.\n\nThe first thing I will say about Batman & Robin is that it's the worst Batman movie of them all hands down no amount of nostalgia or good memories of the movie will change that it is simply awful but having said that it's still a fun movie to watch simply because of how over the top and cheesy the movie is from the over the top acting down to the absolutely terrible Batman jokes like the Bat Credit card and the hilarious Mr Freeze one liners told by Arnold Schwarzenegger himself it is impossible not to laugh when watching this movie it's not the serious Batman movie we wanted and it doesn't do the Batman character justice at all.\n\nThis movie alone was the reason we didn't get a Batman movie for eight years because Batman & Robin failed completely and almost killed the franchise luckily in 2005 we got Batman Begins which introduced the true Dark Knight and would lead to the greatest Batman movie ever made in 2008 Batman The Dark Knight.\n\nI love the cast involved Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr Freeze is hilarious and Uma Thurman as the sexy, seductive Poison Ivy she really makes a deadly character like Poison Ivy a lot of fun and she really does make the character look sexy as hell.\n\nThis movie is absolutely hilarious and is a guilty pleasure for me I don't watch it because it's a good movie I watch it simply because it's entertaining and enjoyable it's essentially Batman the parody it's not to be taken seriously it's a bunch of famous actors dressing in spandex so tight we actually get crotch and butt close ups so if you've always wanted to see a Bat suit with actual nipples and a cod peice then your in luck. This isn't the best Batman movie but try and enjoy it for what it is an hour and a half of entertaining fun.",

Superman does not want a partner because partners tend to want cars that chicks dig.\n\n3. Mr. Freeze, despite being a professor, has very a very limited vocabulary, which includes ice puns or sayings.\n\n4. Professional henchmen, mob etc. will gladly wear hockey mask and tights to match their bosses criteria for wardrobe.\n\n5. Heavy metal doors are the best for sky boarding, skydiving etc. and are known for their crisp clean accuracy and precision.\n\n6. Mr. Freeze, despite being unable to survive without sub cold temperatures, frequently smokes cigars.\n\n7. As a villain it is IMPORTANT to wear fuzzy slippers in front of your men and force them to sing songs like frosty the snowman etc. This helps ensure discipline and fear.\n\n8. Diamonds are typically used today as a source of energy for such things as power suits, weapons etc.\n\n9. Batman and robin, despite being busy with thugs mob bosses etc., have no problem making a appearance at foundations, benefits etc.\n\n10. Batman now has his own bank complete with credit card.\n\n11. Both batman and robin suits come standardized with hockey skates\n\n12. In terms of momentum, if you are riding down a statute, building etc. going about 70 mph, you will be are able to stop dead in your tracts, regardless of such scientifically proved concepts as speed, velocity, gravity. \n\n13. Batman and robin typically fight over love or other emotional problems while fighting villains, thugs etc. This helps the villain understand that batman and robin have feelings like everyone else.\n\n14. Gangs today are all themed based. For example, one gang will all wear fluorescent colored clothes. This is done for fear and intimidation while showing the victim that themes and paint can be useful tools in your opponents mind. \n\n15. Shopping carts are typically found in prison. \n\n16. Officers, Despite being hit with a vapor that causes your lungs to freeze, are highly resistant and are known to survive.\n\n17. If you see a person get hit with a freeze gun DO NOT run, instead look at the person with the gun and either scream, jump at them, or charge towards them. Although ineffective, this causes the user to have momentary fear.\n\n18. As a girl/guy, despite having no formal training in combat, as long as you put on any variation of a bat suit, your skills will improve by a recorded 100%.\n\n19. Vines can be used as a whip and administer the same amount of damage \n\n20. Despite having years of detective skills and deductive reasoning, batman has trouble identifying people who change their hair color , stop wearing glasses (Poison ivy) and people who wear mask large enough to cover the eye area (see Batgirl). \n\n21. Concentrated sunlight from a powerful satellite, cannot be used to melt thing layers of ice on a mirror. Hand held lasers are the best for such problems.\n\n22. Through years of fighting together, batman, robin and bat girl have learned it is best to use language as a junior higher such as \"watch and learn little boy\" \"the heat is on\" \"chicks dig cars\" \n\n23. Mr. Freeze, despite wanting to destroy the world, carries antidotes in his suit. Typically, most antidotes also come in a cool blue color.\n\n24. Most prisons still allow villains to wear battle suits despite being in prison. This is to ensure the prisoner is comfortable in his new surroundings.",

        "reviewText": "Batman & Robin, the big summer movie of 1997, I remember seeing this in the theater when I was 12 and even then I wasn't impressed. But when I was more grown up, I watched this film again, I figured since I loved the 3 previous Batman films, why not give this one another shot? Now, seeing this movie once again, I can understand the low rating on IMDb, this movie was just a pathetic attempt at merchandising Batman and making an over the top action movie that really had nothing to do with Batman. The casting was just oh, so plain wrong. We have Arnold Schwartzenegger as Dr. Freeze?! Not to mention the accent, the character was just someone you felt like you could laugh off. Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl, she was alright, but again, questionable casting since she seemed out of place. Now, George Clooney?! I couldn't believe how Val Kilmer got complained about, but George Clooney I can see why. He was just the most awkward Batman ever and didn't fit the role at all, he was only used for his popularity.\n\nBatman is living it up with his bachelor lifestyle, but Robin is a bit upset that he is living under Batman's shadow and wishes to be the star. Alfred is becoming very sick and needs serious help; his niece, Barbara comes to his aid and hopes to help him and stays with Bruce Wayne. Dr. Freeze is our new villain and is looking for a cure for his wife who is frozen until he can find a cure for her, he also is intending for the world to pay for what has happened to him and his wife for some reason. Dr. Pamela Isley is a plant scientist/right activist and while her boss sees her finding out more than she needs to know about an experiment on his version of Frankenstien, named Bang, he \"kills\" her with her plants. But the plants chemicals have an effect on her and actually make her into Poisen Ivy. She and Freeze team up to take over Gothem and of course to split Batman and Robin forever, oh yeah, then kill them I guess.\n\nBatman & Robin was really beyond over the top, the costumes were a bit silly and the story was just too family friendly. This is Batman, the Dark Knight, it's not meant to be this bright and so crazy. I couldn't believe Joel did this, I really wish I could get past this, I know he's going to get a bad rap for this film for the rest of his career. The acting was just stupid and not true to Batman at all. The problem here was that the story and setting just had nothing to do with what Batman truly is and was just an excuse to spend stupid money. Please, don't watch this film if you love Batman, or you'll be sorry.\n\n2/10",

        "reviewText": "Strangely enough, that's one ice-related pun that Mr.Freeze doesn't use in this film. Though it does adequately describe the movie. What was I thinking, watching Batman & Robin for a third time? Even worse, what was I doing actually starting to enjoy it?\n\nYes, there's something endearingly awful about a film that fails on almost every technical level. But it wasn't always so. The first two films in the franchise, anchored by the strong, and much undervalued lead of Michael Keaton, were enjoyable pop-art excursions by Tim Burton. The first, still by far the best, allowed Jack Nicholson to ham it up amongst retro stylings and the music of Prince. The second, Batman Returns, was a less successful effort to homage German expressionist cinema, the darkest of the four films, and struggled slightly under the weight of three villains.\n\nThe lesson wasn't learnt, and the usage of multiple baddies has been a fixed staple ever since. With the third, Batman Forever, the flat acting of new bat Val Kilmer was coupled with Joel Schumacher's garish direction and Chris O'Donnell's irritating Robin. Akiva Goldsman was now the writer, and any sense of depth had given way to trite puns and disjointed set pieces.\n\nAnd so it was that everything that was symptomatically flawed with the series was expanded upon and magnified for the fourth, and by far the weakest, instalment. George Clooney has accepted a lot of the blame for this film, a humble admission but unfair. While he's clearly miscast as both Batman and Bruce Wayne, he doesn't give a bad performance per se. Rather, it's his back up that lets the side down. Uma Thurman (am I the only one who doesn't think she's that good-looking?) has a great time overdoing it as Poison Ivy, but she's joined by Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze. Schwarz, not exactly known for his acting skill, is unrecognisable under his costume, so what's the point? He gets to call Batman \"Batunbuuurg\", refers to Robin as \"Buuurd Bouy\" and only has 100 lines in total. The fact that 26% of these lines are lame puns on the word \"ice\" that even a two-year-old would struggle to find funny is even more deplorable. And when you hear Freeze tell Batman \"Yew arr not zending mee too da cooola\" the urge to use the video's \"stop\" button is almost insurmountable.\n\nBane makes up the trio, a monosyllabic muscleman in a gimp mask. A completely unnecessary addition, he offers nothing to the plot and goes largely forgotten. The introduction of wonky-mouthed Alicia Silverstone as a fatuous Batgirl character is also grating. And why doesn't her costume come fitted with Batnipples like the rest?\n\nTiny traces of amusement can be gleaned from Ivy's dialogue, with her urges that her \"garden needs tending\" adding some form of adult tone to the humour. However, it's unrelenting innuendo - \"I'll help you grab your rocks\" - does start to wear thin very quickly. I did smile at Batman's cashcard: \"I never leave the cave without it\"; and it's also nice to see some small references from other films. Even if it is just a glimpse of the Riddler's costume from Forever, some guards paraphrasing Cobra or some street bystanders dressed as Clockwork Orange Droogs. In fact, the idea of a Batman film as completely OTT comedy send-up may have worked, were the rest of the humour more sophisticated. \"It's the hockey team from Hell\"; \"So this is where you hang out\"; \"I'll cancel the pizza\"; oh, how lame and functional the dialogue is!\n\nThe film wraps up with a rather pathetic plot contrivance, and George having to dish out bland platitudes. \"Not all heroes wear masks\"; \"to give life... that's true power\". Oh, it really is abominably bad. Batman & Robin exists as a classic example of the Hollywood system folding in under its own weight. However, the universal slating this one got neglects one factor: while the least successful, it still made over $230,000,000 at the box office. I wonder how many people would be satisfied with \"failures\" like that?",

Stunningly awful, this was a disaster from the moment George Clooney traded in his scrubs for the black rubber boots. And it's not even awful in a cute, SHOWGIRLS kind of way. You won't laugh, but you might cry over the fact you've just flushed 125 precious minutes of your life down the crapper.\n\nWhile everyone involved brings shame to their families, from the uncomfortable Clooney as the lamely-interpreted hero to Governornator Arnold Schwarzenegger as the junior-high-dialog-spewing Mr. Freeze, director Joel Schumacher must be punched the hardest. Even those who thought he embarrassed the franchise with the light-hearted BATMAN FOREVER were taken aback. Schumacher treats the audience like a group of eight-year-old boys with ADD, constantly trying to impress us with unexciting action scenes like a hockey-themed opening battle reminiscent of the under-appreciated genius of MIGHTY MORPHIN POWER RANGERS.\n\nThe writers only make things worse with their \"witty\" hero chatter (\"This is why Superman works alone\"... har har, where do they come up with them??) and drawn-out \"human\" angles, such as butler Alfred's illness and a childish romantic triangle between Batman, Robin and the sexy Poison Ivy. This isn't root-on-the-heroes entertainment. On the contrary, you'll find yourself wishing Poison Ivy would tongue kiss both masked men to put us all out of our misery.\n\nI love Batman and superhero flicks. I'm not a movie snob by any means, as I'm willing to forgive many a gaffe. But I absolutely loathe BATMAN & ROBIN. I loathe how it disgraces the characters it depicts. I loathe how the \"talent\" involved is still allowed within 100 feet of a film set or writer's room. It must be said again that BATMAN & ROBIN is the kind of experience that will make you lose all faith in Hollywood -- and humanity.",

        "reviewText": "The film does have nice costumes, and nice sets. Unfortunately that is about it. One major problem is some of the choices of actors.They were all wasted. George Clooney is quite a charming actor, but he is not my idea of Batman. Batman I don't think is supposed to be charming, he's supposed to be dark and brooding, and Clooney lacked that. What would Michael Keaten and Val Kilmer and even Christian Bale say when they see that Batman has turned charming? Chris O' Donnell looked uncomfortable, and in almost every movie where he is a hero, this includes the 1993 version of the Three Musketeers, he is rather lifeless. Uma Thurman does her best, but what they gave her to work with was ridiculous, and she just failed to deliver, while Alicia Silverstone was extremely annoying. The worst case was poor Arnold Schwarznegger. He was completely miscast as Mr Freeze, completely lacking the coldness and evilness that makes the character so memorable. Schwarznegger is a talented actor, but his skills are hidden beyond recognition in this movie, he just looked so uncomfortable and totally out of character. The direction from Joel Schummacher was disappointing as well, it lacked the artistic flair and the temperament that is needed to make a great film. This is further disadvantaged by a truly pathetic script that nobody in the cast could do anything with.(these actors deserved so much better)The special effects were okay, but very confused in terms of execution. In conclusion, not the worst movie, I have ever seen, but it is one of those films, where everything needed to make it memorable falls flat. 3/10 for effort. Bethany Cox",

It did suffer from the lack of top of the line talent (Jack Nicholson).\n\n And then Mr. Schumacher ruined everything. \n\n\"Batman Forever\" is a shame of a movie, but NOTHING compared to what this piece of garbage is. Since its from the same series, there is no excuse for the director to run wild and away from the spirit of the originals, in which a sad soul has to fight crime in order to mantain sanity. In Schumacher movies, Batman has to have the coolest cars, to kiss the most beautiful girls and to have a lot of fun while doing this. The first 2 movies acknowledged that killing or hurting people was a conscious choice which was painfully taken by Batman; in the last 2 it is as if violence was fun and part of Batman¬¥s life.\n\nThere are so many wrong things about this film it is useless to count them. But there are two things that are an insult to every film goer: the Batmobile is reduced to a clownmobile, and Batman¬¥s suit has NIPPLES in it. What a disgrace of a movie. This doesn't even qualify as \"so bad it is good\". This is merely \"so bad it is bad\".",

It is hard to believe that money was spent to make this. It could have been used on something else (charity I suppose). I was 12 when I went to see this and it broke my heart. Batman was my favorite comic book and character when I was a kid and this film broke my spirit. The excellence of the Tim Burton/Michael Keaton films are long gone. The dark emotional center and development of the hero and the villains is sidelined for action sequences, action sequences and some more action sequences, some of them incorporating the worst CGI and model work ever seen on film. \n\nThe casting itself had to the potential to make a good film. George Clooney could have made a great Batman (square jawed, popular with the ladies), the only thing going against him being that can be too laid back (maybe with a better script he could do the darker material). Uma Thurman is perfect for Poison Ivy. She is a good looking yet quirky actress, but you wouldn't know it by the emphasis on camp context and innuendo in this film. Arnie is maybe a little miscast as Mr Freeze, but he does well getting a chance to use some 'great' puns, but someone who can come across as more evil would  have been better. Then there is Chris O'Donnell and Alicia Silverstone as Robin and Batgirl. Let's just say more charisma can come from a line of fridge freezers with nothing in them. The only decent performance comes from Michael Gough as Alfred, only one of two actors to have appeared in all four films. His performance is wonderful in this otherwise mess of a film.\n\nThe blame for this disaster can be laid at the hands of Joel Schumacher. His direction misplaced and his intentions misguided. He may have redeemed himself with Phone Booth, but he will always be the man who destroyed Batman in my eyes.",

But the show still betrayed all the emotion and grimness of Batman's themes.\n\nIn Batman & Robin, Schumacher seems to be getting back to those roots. He treats the entire Batman franchise like a joke. Even if it was funny, this would be betraying the name of Batman. But here, seeing as it's NOT funny, it only succeeds in becoming the worst of the Batman movies, and, arguably, the worst films ever created. And I'm taking into account Plan 9 From Outer Space, Gigli, and You Got Served.\n\nGeorge Clooney just plays George Clooney. Which is the road he usually takes, but this suave, dashing, and charming Batman seems more like Mystery Men's Captain Amazing than the crimefighter of legend.\n\nThere's Chris O'Donnell, the angst-ridden Robin trying to break out of Batman's shadow. The only thing he ever really does is act like a child.\n\nAlicia Silverstone. Wow. I seriously wonder what makes someone say, \"Hmm, who should we get to play Batgirl . . . I know! Alicia Silverstone!\" No offense to Alicia, but she's out in right field on this one. Her tough-girl performance is sprinkled with reminders of her Clueless days. But all that aside, she actually does very little.\n\nNow, onto the villains. Uma Thurman, who we know CAN act, is hamming it up to ridiculous proportions. First, when she's playing the nerdy Dr. Pamela, she exaggerates that to a level I thought impossible. And then she inexplicably turns into an extremely sexualized villainess whose plan, by the way, would kill all the plants she advocated protecting.\n\nArnold seems like the worst possible choice for Mr. Freeze. I mean, of all the Batman villains I could see him playing - Bane, for christ's sake - Mr. Freeze is not on that list. He possesses none of the emotionless, calculated, and cold (no pun intended) sociopathy which makes Mr. Freeze such a good character.\n\nAnd then, all that aside, they're handed ridiculous catch phrases and cliches they're expected to say with any level of sincerity? At one point Mr. Freeze says \"chill out.\" Of all the ways it sounds, menacing is not among them.\n\nSeriously, I'd have more respect for Schumacher if I discovered that he hated Batman, and had intentionally ruined it with this garbage. Then, this might actually be just his own personal joke. Instead, it borders on a travesty of good cinema. I only wish that 0 stars was a selectable option at the imdb, for this film ALONE.",

The adorable Chris O'Donnell plays Robin, the equally adorable Alicia Silverstone plays Batgirl, Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a frosty yet comical villain, and Uma Thurman plays a wicked seductress. See what I mean? You'll probably forget George Clooney is even in it.\n\nUnfortunately, this installment wasn't even as successful as its predecessor Batman Forever, which wasn't very good. The consistently good feature shared by both films is the kid-friendly attitude. These are comic book movies, and should be able to be enjoyed by kids of all ages-aren't young folks the target audiences for comic books? The later volumes are far too dark and frightening. The darkest part of the movie is an uninteresting sideplot about Batman's butler Alfred's health-but it can still turn into a funny scene if you make fun of George Clooney's smirk and head tilt instead of paying attention to what he's saying. So, if you're looking for a good one to start your youngster on, this is it.",

Even by his standards the level of acting is shockingly poor. Also Mr. Freeze was an intelligent guy in the comics then it doesn't do to cast a guy who can't even speak American without a heavy accent. Despite Schwarzenegger's intellect (he is one of the governors in USA with the highest IQ) he comes off as an ignorant person because of his accent.\n\n2. Allow George Clooney to play Batman as gay. I am actually a fan of Clooney but his performance in this movie is disgraceful to say the least. He has stated himself that he found it amusing to play Bruce Wayne as gay. I, a great fan of the comics, did not find this amusing at all.\n\n3. Move away from the serious tone of the first movies (which made them successful) and do a poor imitation of the 60's camp show with Adam West.\n\n4. Cast Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy. I usually think Uma Thurman is hot but her overacting in this movie is so distasteful she loses all kind of sexual appeal, which in turn destroys any kind of menace the character should have had. Poor, poor, poor.\n\n5. Allowing Joel Schumacher free reins over the movie after seeing which direction he was taking the franchise with the previous movie. This is just the sign of a bad producer.\n\n6. Remove all tension in the fight sequences by dumbing them down to the point where it is beyond stupidity. Batman and Robin playing hockey with a diamond is not my idea of a cool fight scene. Several fight scenes actually had me gasping with shock as to how poor they are.\n\n7. Cast Alicia Silverstone as a bad girl (Batgirl). She cannot pull it off.\n\n8. The nipples people. THE NIPPLES!!! How ridiculous is this?! Batman and Robin's suits have nipples but when Batgirl makes her entrance notice the lack of the same.\n\n9. Write a script that makes no sense whatsoever.\n\n10. Turn one of the most memorable villains of the comics into a brainless henchman. I am referring of course to Bane who in the comics is one of Batman's worst enemies because of his strength and intellect. Bane has actually beaten Batman on several occasions and although The Joker is undoubtedly Batman's nemesis Bane isn't far off. I squirm with the way they treated him in this movie.\n\nIn my honest opinion this could in fact be the worst movie... no scratch that... worst thing man has ever created. So with that I give my final score.\n\n1/10",

Arnold delivers cheesy puns and one-liners galore, they do suck but are hilarious at the same time. George Clooney does such a bad job, you can't help laughing. Everybody is so over-the-top and cheesy, you have to laugh. That may be why Chris O'Donnell's and Silverstone's careers were pretty much ruined after this: gets recognized for Scent of a Woman; breaks out in Batman Forever; then gets screwed in this. Silverstone does some music videos, breaks out in Clueless, then gets screwed by this. All other actors pretty much had their feet firmly planted. The set design and special effects were actually well-done. But people criticized this portion for being too weird-looking and overly-extravagant. Maybe they were, but doing all that the way Schumacher did is extremely difficult. Plus it saves us from the bad story and bad acting. I did say the acting is funny, but after a while it gets to be too much. It starts off fun, but eventually gets boring since there is no good plot or characters. It just keeps going until you have enough. I know that two hours isn't very long for a movie, but in this case, it was. Just take twenty minutes away and it would have been better.\n\n2/4",

In fact, although it's not my favorite in the series (my vote goes to Batman Returns), I still found this refreshing in its cartoon-ish innocence. After all, it is based on a cartoon, so what is so unforgivable about making it light-hearted just once. Does everything have to be dark and brooding? I hope not. Well, unfortunately, people like the darkness more than the light. Just look at the reviews here, for an example of that.\n\nI just went along for the ride on this, enjoying the outlandish characters and corny-but-humorous lines delivered by Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze and Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy. Both were a lot of fun to watch. Batman, meanwhile, has been played by some many actors I don't care anymore who has the role.....its' nothing to get serious about, anyway.\n\nWhoever seems to play him does a decent job. This Batman version seems a lot more softer character, higher-principled and compassionate....sort of the real-life wacko (George Clooney) who views himself as such as a knight in shining armor for the typical Hollywood Left Wing crowd. But....we'll forgive him, for he not knows what he says.\n\nI appreciated the added humor in this film, the fact there almost no profanity, unlike the other versions; the wild special effects, ogling Uma Thurman, who looked fantastic; great color and surround sound; interesting sets and a nice message at the end.\n\nThe negatives were: a little too much action which can make you dizzy trying to follow; a somewhat-annoying Robin (Chris O'Donnell); Alicia Silverstone's role as Batgirl adding nothing to the film; and a little too many sexual innuendos to counteract the absence of profanity, I suppose.\n\nOverall, a fun movie not to be taken seriously: simply a cartoon come to life, which is what some people think it should have been in the first place.",

Interestingly, despite there being many horrible superhero movies (such as \"The Spirit\" and \"Catwoman\"), this and \"Superman IV\" are the only ones currently on the list....so it's quite a dubious achievement!\n\nDespite \"Batman & Robin\" being a terrible film, it is interesting to note that despite the film costing an ungodly $125,000,000 to make...it DID manage to earn about double the cost...making it Warner Brothers' biggest moneymaker of the year. It's bad press did, however, help destroy the franchise until it was revived and revamped several years later with Christian Bale and Chrisopher Nolan.\n\nWhen the film started, I could almost see instantly why the movie was a stinker. It was completely cartoonish compared to the previous Batman films of the 80s and 90s. Seeing Batman and Robin in a hockey game with Mr. Freeze and his minions simply made me cringe...as did the sound effects throughout the film. Several times, the punching and kicking sounds were pretty much straight from the campy old TV series....and fans must have been infuriated to see the series turned into a dumbed down cartoonish nightmare. Did the stupidity in this scene get any worse in this opening scene? Yup...when Freeze escapes in a rocket (???) and Batman and Robin chase the film leaps into ultra-stupid mode! It ended hellishly, with Batman and Robin both jumping from the rocket on sky surfboards and they miraculously survived--and during their descent Robin yells out 'Cowabunga'!! What follows rarely got much better...and again and again the film resorted to cartoonism instead of making a decent film that wouldn't infuriate audiences.\n\nAnother horrible scene was the homage to Marlene Dietrich in her dance scene from \"Blonde Venus\". The Dietrich dance was dumb....the version with Uma Thurman managed to make it even stupider. Seeing her in magenta gorilla costume was indeed stupid!\n\nTo make everything worse, Miss Thurman overacted terribly throughout the film and I'd say she was the weakest and most annoying actor in the cast....and I assume she was only doing what the director and writer instructed her to do. The same can be said about all the horrid puns uttered by Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze....he was just doing what he was told to do. And, ultimately the crap dialog between the three crime fighters is pretty much the same...the delivered the crap that they were given.\n\nIn order to have made a good film, \"Batman & Robin\" should have learned SOMETHING from \"Batman\" (1989). It should have been darker, had one GOOD villain instead of three lousy ones and not given way to cheap stunts and gimmickery. Instead of a dark, brooding story, this one looks almost like it was filmed inside a carnival fun house...complete with glow in the dark neon paint and one dimensional characters.\n\nOverall, a truly horrid pile of vomit. The film manages to earn a 2...but only because for $125,000,000 the film ultimately must look good...at least at times.\n\nSo was there anything I liked about the movie? Well, I did laugh at the scene where Mr. Freeze was watching the Snow Miser from \"The Year Without a Santa Claus\" TV special...and he tried to make his minions sing along with him. It was dumb...but it did make me laugh and was one of the few moments that I didn't hate myself for watching this movie.",

Most of the bad things you've heard about this movie are true, but that doesn't stop the film from being entertaining.\n\nSeeing Batman and Arnold Schwarzenegger duke it out is reason enough to see \"Batman & Robin.\" But while Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze carries impressive weapons and strikes a menacing figure, his lines are cheesy instead of threatening. In fact, cheesier lines haven't been heard since Adam West played Batman.\n\nGeorge Clooney makes a likable super hero. Unfortunately, he's not really Batman. Batman is tormented by inner demons. George Clooney never stops smiling. Even though Adam West's lines as Batman were unbelievable, he still said them with a straight face, as if they were serious. George Clooney says even serious lines with a cheesy grin. He's believable as rich playboy Bruce Wayne, but, even though his attempt to get Batman to lighten up was a noble idea, the character should be played with some darkness.\n\nStill, there's a great warmness between Clooney and Michael Gough, who plays Alfred the butler, and between Clooney and Chris O'Donnel, who plays Robin the Boy Wonder. Bruce Wayne's personal life is in turmoil. Alfred, his friend and mentor, is dying, and Bruce must cope with the idea that he might lose him. Robin is tired of standing in Batman's shadow and begins to jeopardize the Dynamic Duo's partnership. Both subplots are well acted and touching.\n\nThe plot is completely preposterous, but that's to be expected from a movie based on comic books. It's still entertaining. The gadgets are impressive, the action scenes are well done, and the Batmobile, as always, is cool. The lead actresses, Elle MacPherson, Alicia Silverstone, and Uma Thurman, are talented and very easy on the eyes. Uma Thurman, as the evil Poison Ivy, possesses a magic powder that will make men do anything for her. This seems redundant to me, since her sexy costumes alone are enough to make men do anything for her.\n\nIf I had to choose a worst out of the Batman movies, I'd pick this one.

        "reviewText": "One thing that strikes me from reading these reviews is that people have sadly forgotten how to appreciate 'camp'. Back in the '60's, camp was in vogue, thanks to the 'Batman' television series, as well as movies such as 'Our Man Flint/In Like Flint' and Dean Martin's 'Matt Helm' series ( which began with 'The Silencers' ).\n\nWhat is camp? It is a ridiculous story approached with deadly seriousness on the part of the main characters, so serious in fact that it becomes amusing.\n\nSo, yes, 'Batman & Robin' is campy. And that's how I like the Caped Crusader. Taken seriously, I find him a bit of a bore. So many modern movies are 'dark' now that I have to take a flashlight every time I visit the local multiplex. \n\n'B & R' was the third sequel to the 1989 Tim Burton blockbuster, which starred Michael Keaton. Both left the series at the same time. Their replacements were Joel Schumacher and Val Kilmer. Schumacher retained the dark, brooding atmosphere of the Burton films, while bringing in some of the colourful campery of the '60's series. He was ripped to pieces for doing so but I think he was right. Kilmer was an adequate replacement. George Clooney donned the cowl and cape for 'B & R ', and was better than Kilmer, but Keaton was still far and away the best. \n\nWarner Bros.' 'Batman' franchise was bound to run out of puff, and did. All franchises run out of puff in the end. James Bond did with 'The Man With The Golden Gun' in 1974. The less said about 'Superman 4: The Quest For Peace' the better. But they both recovered. Ditto 'Batman'. 'Batman Begins' could never have been made were it not for 'B & R '. \n\nThe plot concerns 'Mr.Freeze' who is trying to save his dying wife by freezing Gotham City...something like that. It is not important. People who go to 'Batman' in search of great plots are fools.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger was miscast as 'Mr.Freeze' - the man cannot, and never could, act. Patrick Stewart should have gotten the role. Then there's Uma Thurman as 'Poison Ivy', a villain I'm not familiar with, but she was the best thing in the movie. Sexy, sassy and cool. This was how she should have been in 'The Avengers'. Alicia Silverstone as 'Batgirl'? Another mistake. 'Batgirl' is to 'Batman' what 'Scrappy Doo' is to 'Scooby Doo'. Chris O'Donnell reprised his role as 'Robin', but like 'Batgirl', I never could stand the character.\n\nAs soon as the title of this film was announced, I thought: \"Oh oh trouble!\". Its so crass. 'Batman Supreme' would have been better.\n\nSo with all these strikes against it, why is 'B & R' so much fun? Simple. For those of us who fondly remember the '60's version, it works perfectly as a homage. If you ask me, they should have gone further by putting 'Pow!', 'Zap!' and 'Kerpow!' on the fights. Nothing in the movie makes sense, nor is it meant to. Just as reality makes no sense. Don't go to 'B & R' expecting Fellini, and you'll have a great time. The opening chase alone is worth purchasing the D.V.D. for. \n\nTo all the doom mongers, I say this - lighten up! Watch 'B & R' and enjoy. We can get 'dark' and 'edgy' movies anywhere. 'Batman' is not 'Seven'!",

        "reviewText": "This is the most disappointing movie in the history of film for me.\n\nA 2 out of 10 is generous. I should give it a zero strictly based on the Bat Credit Card scene. \n\nEvery single individual whether it be producers, director, writer or actors (minus Chris O'Donnell) should be \"Bat-Whipped\" for this piece of junk. This is your typical \"absolutely cannot fail\" franchise in film getting raped by studio execs making critical content decisions about a film when they have no talent to do so. Batman is popular simply because of the comic book not because of that retarded TV show starring Adam West, but this movie is more fashioned after that campy trash. This was nothing but a slap in the face to every true fan of the Batman. The direction of Joel Schumacher was deplorable. The set designs looked cheap (the ice looked and acted like dried craft glue) and were visually painful, especially the overuse of the red neon hue in many scenes. The digital effects were OK but often over done. The production cost was extensive, and I wonder what percentage of the budget went to the salaries of Arnold, George, Uma and Alicia. I'm sure it was high. I know Arnold got $20 million, so the percentage had to be fairly high. Well, everyone one of them needed to give back large portions of their salaries because their performances were atrocious. Alicia Silverstone needs to give her entire salary back. Hers was probably one the worst performances ever in a major motion picture. Arnold can't act anyway so I wasn't really expecting much, but I was disappointed when I heard he was cast as Freeze because he in no way fits that character. Freeze was a scientist and when I look at Arnold my first thought is not \"Scientist\". Ben Kingsly or Patrick Stewart would have fit better. Uma, who is normally a credible actress, was too \"drama queen\" which made it hard to immerse yourself in scenes she was in. Clooney was totally miscast as Bruce Wayne/Batman. I mean it's hard not to laugh when Batman is shorter than Robin. George like Uma was too overly dramatic, especially in scenes with Alfred, which made it hard to take him seriously. Chris O'Donnell was really the only actor that seemed real. With all that, I would have to say the overwhelmingly worst part of this movie was the script. Akiva Goldsman should have been banned from Hollywood after this script. It was a completely brainless jumbled mess. The story, which was pitiful at best, gets completely lost in entirely too many characters. It was so frustrating seeing the origins of certain characters ripped too shreds as Goldsman attempted to jam them into the script. Batgirl, who should have never been in this film in the first place, was changed from Commissioner Gordon's daughter to Alfred's niece, which made absolutely no sense. In an attempt, to explain why Freeze was so muscular it was explained he was an Olympic gymnast. How freakin' stupid is that? Gymnasts by necessity need to be small in stature to perform well in gymnastics and Arnold is enormous. Goldsman's use of dialogue was highly irritating consisting of nothing but one juvenile one-liner after another after another after another. One other thing that really irritated me was the complete mishandling and waste of the character Bane. Bane is a much more complex and vicious villain in the comics, and this movie version with Bane reduces him to a mindless henchman. Bane deserves much more character development than he received in B&R. The same thing happened in Forever, when one of the most highly complex and interesting villains in the comics, Two-Face, got reduced to second billing. Note to Warner Bros. stop screwing with Batman he can sell himself, and stop trying to cram so many characters into the films, and understand nobody wants to see a Campy Caped Crusader.",

Stories about mermaids fighting wars in different galaxies, that is easy to describe; but writing about life, sometimes all you can say is, \"It's about life.\" Batman and Robin is a story about a place, a place most people might not be able to conceive: where things are dying, where people survive off liquor and cigarettes, where those who are supposed to love us drive knives into our backs. Clooney is good when he is bad and good when he is good, so no point in dwelling on him. It's worth watching this movie just to see him.

        "reviewText": "I hope Tim Burton takes over the Batman movie series. If WB didn't learn their lesson after this one, they never will. Batman Forever I liked, but it foreshadowing this movie, which turned the once cool, dark, Batman-worthy Burton version into a glow-in-the-dark, kiddy-show, campy version. I still say this movie is OK, but if something isn't done about Joel, I won't be saying this for much longer.\n\nHere we go...\n\nBatman: I am so surprised that everyone says that George Clooney is the best part of this movie. He is the worst Batman in my opinion.(I think Kilmer was the best) Clooney isn't that bad, but I didn't think he fit. And the Batman Credit Card? I wanted to puke in my popcorn when I saw that!\n\nRobin: Robin reminds me a lot of Luke Skywalker, minus the coolness. Chris O'Donnell plays the part well. Unfortunately, the part is a whiny, annoying, untrustworthy, gullible, stupid sidekick. Don't bother defending Robin, he isn't worth it. He was OK in Batman Forever, but his character isn't improving.\n\nBatgirl: You know, we really didn't need another sidekick right away, did we? Why Batgirl now? Save her for number 6, for crying out loud! Alicia Silverstone is great (though not in this movie) but that doesn't hide the fact that the character shouldn't be there. And the constant battle of the sexes between her and Robin are annoying.\n\nMr. Freeze: Ugh. The only thing that saved this character was the fact that it was Arnold, and that didn't save it. I won't forgive Joel for putting a great guy like Arnold into a crappy role like this. Yeah, his thing was ice, but that doesn't mean EVERY LINE OVER 5 SENTENCE (no exaggeration) had to be an ice pun!\n\nPoison Ivy: The thing that really saved this movie. Uma Thurman did a great acting job for this part, despite some other opinions. She was very sexy and interesting, unlike Mr. Freeze. In some parts, you were waiting to get back to her scenes. This was the only interesting villain in the movie.\n\nBane: I am stunned at Joel's ability to take a cool villain from the comics like Bane and turn him into a drooling, stupid, grunt-like idiot. I am too disgusted to talk about it.\n\nAlfred: Alfred is just as good as always in this movie, although it is getting annoying how he wants everyone he knows to be one of Batmans sidekicks.\n\nCommishoner Gordan: You know, in Batman you had respect for this guy. Now his only scenes are when he drools over Poison Ivy. Sad.\n\nOverall, Uma Thurman's sexy role in this movie alone is enough for you to watch this movie. To die by getting kissed by Uma, what a great way to die! :)",

      "text": "In Gotham City, Batman and Robin attempt to stop Mr. Freeze from stealing a cache of diamonds, but he escapes. The Dynamic Duo soon learn that Mr. Freeze was once a scientist named Victor Fries who became dependent on a diamond-powered subzero suit following an accident in a cryogenics lab he was using to find a cure for his wife, Nora Fries, who was suffering from a terminal illness called MacGregor's Syndrome.\n\nIn South America, Pamela Isley is working under Dr. Jason Woodrue, a mad scientist who is experimenting with the Venom drug. She witnesses Woodrue use the formula to turn a diminutive convict into a hulking monstrosity dubbed \"Bane\". Woodrue and Isley argue over the use of the drug and Woodrue overturns a shelf of various toxins onto her. She transforms into the beautiful and seductive Poison Ivy before killing Woodrue with a kiss from her now-poisonous lips. She finds that Wayne Enterprises funded Woodrue, so she takes Bane with her to Gotham.\n\nMeanwhile, butler Alfred Pennyworth's niece, Barbara Wilson, makes a surprise visit and is invited by Bruce Wayne to stay at Wayne Manor until she goes back to school. Alfred is revealed to be suffering from MacGregor's Syndrome.\n\nPoison Ivy interrupts a Wayne Enterprises press conference to propose a project that could help the environment. Bruce Wayne declines her offer, as it would kill millions of people. That night, a charity event is held by Wayne Enterprises with special guests Batman and Robin in attendance. Poison Ivy decides to seduce them. Freeze crashes the party and steals a diamond from the event. He is captured and sent to a chamber prison in Arkham Asylum, but escapes with the help of Ivy and Bane.\n\nFreeze and Ivy return to his hideout to retrieve his diamonds and his wife. Ivy and Bane attack Batman and Robin who are investigating the hideout. Ivy finds Freeze's vulnerable wife suspended in cryosleep but deliberately cuts off her life support by kicking loose her power cord. Ivy leaves her to die and blames Batman which enrages Freeze.\n\nRobin becomes smitten with Ivy and begins to rebel against Batman. Ivy imprisons Robin when he does not give in to her charms; she also subdues Batman when he arrives to save his partner. Just then, Barbara - now a costumed crimefighter calling herself Batgirl - shows up and fights Ivy, eventually defeating her.\n\nBatman, Robin, and Batgirl decide to go after Freeze together. By the time they get to the observatory where Freeze and Bane are, Gotham is completely frozen. Robin and Batgirl confront Bane and defeat him, while Batman and Freeze begin to fight each other, with Batman winning. Batgirl and Robin unfreeze Gotham.\n\nBatman then shows Freeze a recording of Ivy during her fight with Batgirl, in which the former brags about killing Nora. Batman then tells Freeze that his wife is not dead; she has been restored in cryogenic slumber and moved to Arkham so he can finish his research. Batman asks Freeze for the cure he has created for the first stage of MacGregor's Syndrome for Alfred; Freeze atones for his misdeeds by giving him the medicine he had developed.\n\nIvy is shown imprisoned in Arkham with a vengeful Freeze as her cellmate. Alfred is eventually healed. Everyone agrees to let Barbara stay at the mansion. The film closes as our three heroes run in front of the Bat-signal"

Schumachers approach is too comical and Gotham has lost the sinister ora that Burton created, Val Kilmer is OK as the bat, and he certainly helps save the film from total disaster.\n\nAll the other characters are new, Nicole Kidman (Dr. Chase Meridian) brings sex appeal, but her character delivers little more. Chris O'Donnell is introduced as Robin, and his martial arts antics do add something to the film. Tommy Lee Jones plays Two-Face and as usual his performance is decent, but the star of the show is Jim Carrey as the Riddler; his performance is both camp and eccentric, and it hits the mark brilliantly.\n\nThe problem with the movie, although i did enjoy it, is the total change in style; the backdrop of Gotham city is no longer dark and Gothic and the series is moving away from Batmans comic roots.\n\nThis was the beginning of the end, and it was followed by Batman and Robin. Thank god for Batman Begins.\n\n6/10",

        "reviewText": "Batman Forever may be the most unfairly criticzed super-hero film ever made. It's sandwiched between the fandom of the Burton and Nolan films while simultaneously blamed for leading to Batman and Robin. If you compare it to the darker and more gothic Burton films and are disappointed Keaton isn't still playing Batman, of course you're not gonna enjoy it. If you compare it to the more serious neo-realism of the Nolan films, again you're not gonna enjoy it. What is it you ask? Batman Forever essentially plays out like a live action cartoon and it does this very well. If you watch it through that lens instead of judging it for what it's not you'll find that Batman Forever actually has superior continuity and pacing than any other Batman film except maybe the 1966 version. This is coming from someone who's favorite film is Batman 1989 and a big Tim Burton fan. It honestly baffles me to hear people rave about how great Batman Returns is and then go on to bash Batman Forever. While Returns has a ton going for it, it really suffers from the same core problem as Batman and Robin; the director getting too cute with creative control. All Joel Schumacher did was set out to make a fun super-hero film with something for everyone to enjoy and I honestly think he succeeded with Forever. With Batman and Robin he went too flamboyant just like Burton went too zany and weird with Returns. The first time around both directors got it right testing the waters with their own respective styles. Everything in the film is very cartoonish and if you appreciate it from that perspective it's really quite masterful in a lot of subtle and not so subtle ways. Although Batman The Animated Series was largely influenced by the Burton movies Forever really seems like it's bringing that onto the big screen with real actors and real sets which is quite a feat. Schumacher just added more color and neon which honestly is a welcome change from the stark art deco gothic flavor present in Returns. Nothing wrong with that flavor in Returns, it's just that Burton went all in and we didn't necessarily need more of the same. Batman Returns actually has considerably different art direction from Batman 1989 yet you rarely hear fans complain about that difference or even acknowledge it.\n\nNicole Kidman is perfectly cast as Chase Meridian and I like Chris O'Donnell as Robin even though he was probably a tad old. Everyone criticizes Val Kilmer for being too bland compared to Keaton but honestly the latter wouldn't have worked at all in the film the way it was done. Since Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey are both such strong personalities a more stoic Kilmer contrasts that well. Batman Forever really is Jim Carrey's vehicle though. You watch Batman Forever for Jim Carrey the same way you watch Batman 1989 for Jack Nicholson.",

We do have a new but every exceptional Batman, Val Kilmer, who has a tough role to fit into after the great performances Michael Keaton brought. Nicole Kidman plays Chase, a beautiful and intelligent scientist who has the hots for Batman more than Bruce, she does a great job and looks so sexy! Jim Carrey, the master of comedy, takes the role of The Riddler, only he can bring the true comic relief and was a great choice. Tommy Lee Jones, as Two Face, was also great and so believable as a scary villain. Last but not least, Chris O'donnel as the wimsical, but more serious than anything version of Robin. The dynamic duo are finally put together for this masterpiece of a sequel! \n\nBatman is now fighting Two Face, or Harvey Dent, who was brutally scarred on one side of his face in a court case of his when he was a lawyer. When he fails one night to successfully capture Two Face, he meets Dr. Chase Meridian, a beautiful scientist and journalist. She is just fascinated with him and it's almost love at first sight for her. Batman of course is falling for her, but is playing hard to get. When Bruce Wayne makes a move on her though, she accepts and they attend a charity circus together, they see the Flying Gracins, a family of flying acrobats, but when the party is interrupted by Two Face and he demands to find out the true identity of Batman otherwise he'll set off a bomb in the circus! When the Gracins try to stop it and Dick Gracin, the youngest flying member goes his separate way to stop it himself, the family is on top of some very high up beams and wire which Two Face stops them by shooting the wires causing the Gracins to fall down to their deaths in front of everyone. When Dick stops the bomb, he is too late to see his family lying dead on the floor.\n\nHe comes to live with Bruce and wants revenge on Two Face and promises death and justice! It's not too soon that he discovers that Bruce is Batman and wants to be him at first, but then decides that he shouldn't take over but they should become partners! Batman refuses knowing that it's too dangerous; he continues his affair with Chase. But there is a new problem, an angry employee, Edward Nygmam, at Bruce's business now wants to destroy Batman and become evil! Who better to join up with than Two Face? He also has a machine that can read a person's mind and makes it tell the person's deepest darkest secrets. When Bruce comes to a party after Edward is successful in selling these machines, he tempts Bruce into the biggest machine of all and finds out what Bruce has been hiding for so long. When Batman and Chase are together, she confesses to Batman that she is now falling for Bruce. When she and Bruce have a get together, he wishes to tell her the truth, you know a little bit before this scene he said to Alfred \"I've never been in love before\", what happened to Vicki Vale and Catwoman? I always wondered that! But anyways, Two Face's gang kidnaps Chase and now Bruce must save her, but his bat cave has been destroyed by The Riddler! With the riddles that Edward sent to Bruce as clues, he and Alfred put everything together and know that it's not going to be easy to defeat this powerful team, that's where Dick comes in, or now known as Robin! Can the dynamic duo save Chase in time and save the world from getting their brains sucked into The Riddler's and can Robin get the revenge he's wanted for so long with Two Face?\n\nBatman Forever is a fantastic installation into the Batman series. I would highly recommend it! It's got action, romance, drama, comedy, and great sets! Among a fantastic soundtrack featuring U2 and Seal's famous \"Kiss from a Rose\". It's a good movie and should be seen by every Batman fan! \n\n8/10",

Well, \"Batman Forever\" was getting silly, but it still had Jim Carrey to steal the show as The Riddler (\"Batman and Robin\" had about as many good qualities as a barrel of toxic waste). Personally, I don't know why they had to have Batman (Val Kilmer) going through therapy; remove that and he still would have been a cool superhero with neat gadgets. Tommy Lee Jones wasn't bad as Two-Face. Nicole Kidman and Chris O'Donnell, as Dr. Chase Meridian and Robin, respectively, didn't really add anything.\n\nOverall, the point is that when Joel Schumacher took over directing, the franchise went downhill. Part of the problem was that while Tim Burton created an eerie Gotham City that looked like New York in the 1940s, Joel Schumacher created a Gotham City that looked like it was trying too hard to be \"Blade Runner\".\n\nSo, the franchise starting getting stale with this one, but Jim Carrey kept the movie from being unwatchable. As Edward Nygma, one of Bruce Wayne's employees, he had some great lines. In the movie, Nygma proposes a device that rests atop TV sets and reads peoples' minds, but Wayne rejects it, considering it too dangerous. Thus, Nygma becomes The Riddler, and he's the best character in the movie.",

The film isn't as good or as dark as the first two films, but it is a huge improvement over Batman and Robin, the less said about that film the better. Anyway, this film is quite possibly the fastest and the funniest of the series, but despite all this there are some hit and miss elements. Chris O'Donnell is annoying and lifeless as Robin, the script has its weak spots despite some terrific lines from Jim Carrey and while Nicole Kidman was bearable, her character could have been written better. However, it is stylishly filmed with Oscar-nominated photography and excellent special effects, the direction is surprisingly more efficient and the action hurls along at an exciting and breakneck pace. The acting is good on the most part with Val Kilmer brooding as Batman and Michael Gough perfect as Alfred. The villains steal the show though, while Tommy Lee Jones is excellent as usual as Two Face Jim Carrey is the one with the best lines and delivery as the Riddler. Overall, hit and miss but a decent entry in the Batman franchise. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

The main difference of this Batman to Tim Burton's is he is not as dark as before. This time the caped crusader is up against the perfect villain duo of Tommy Lee Jones as the dangerous Harvey Two-Face, and with him is the hilarious but also nasty likes of Jim Carrey as the Riddler. There is also the appearance of Nicole Kidman, and later Chris O'Donnell becomes Batman's remembered sidekick the boy wonder Robin. Jim Carrey is more funny than the Jack Nicholson was, but this film is still not as great as the first one. Also starring Drew Barrymore as Sugar, Pat Hingle as Comissioner Gordon and Michael Gough as Alfred. A good array of action and adventure is in store. It was nominated the Oscars Best Cinematography, Best Sound Effects Editing and Best Sound, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Song for \"Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me\", also featuring Seal's \"Kiss From a Rose\". Batman was number 84 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, Jim Carrey was number 47, and Nicole Kidman number 21 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!",

When villains Two-Face and the Riddler team up to take over Gotham City by beating Batman, the dynamic duo find themselves in a battle for the city.\n\nThis third of the series rings the alarm bells early when the credits tell us that Burton is out and thoughtless crowd pleaser Schumacher is in!  If that's not bad enough Keaton is replaced by Val Kilmer.  The story to this makes the first two films look like Shakespeare.  Here the script is pointless and any character development is thrown out the window.  The story is little more than an excuse for two things, 1 - big action scenes and 2 - big hammy performances from whoever is playing the villains this time.  As such it doesn't do anything new.  The main loss is the loss of darkness - Schumacher maximises the audience by making it kiddie friendly and losing any edge the original had.\n\nThe action scenes are all OTT and mere spectacle, but they lack tension and excitement and it's really hard to care.  Outside of the spectacle we are left with the performances.  Carrey is good if you like his brand of mugging, but he does get tiresome in his cartoon character role.  Jones is wasted as Two-Face and is forced to sit in the shadow of Carrey's ham. Kilmer is a non-entity, Batman comes second to the villains and the attempts to give him a character are ham-fisted and clumsy.  Kidman is a stupid love interest and there is no chemistry between her and Kilmer.  O'Donnell is OK but did we need a Robin?\n\nOverall this is a step away from the comic book and a leap towards the camp 1960's Batman.  Schumacher takes what should be a dark, almost disturbing story of a man who is not too far removed from the super-villains he must catch and turns it into a childish ill-formed Happy Meal.

        "reviewText": "I loved the first two Batman movies, and honestly would have loved to see Burton go on to direct more entries in the series, but Joel Shumacher's Batman Forever is not at all an unwelcome change. I think some people recollect this film and automatically associate it with Shumacher's awful second Batman attempt, Batman & Robin. That is the bad movie. This is not. People also seem to forget how big of a hit it was. Artistically, there were things it got wrong and didn't do as well as the others, but there were things it did so much better, too. For one thing, this is the only 'Batman' with a decent soundtrack to its name (including 2 great songs by U2 and Seal).\n\nIn some ways you can look at this as a transition from the dark, tortured Batman to a Batman who has finally conquered his personal demons and gone on to be happier in being a man who fights crime in the night dressed up in rubber. For this one it was good, 'cause that's essentially how it ends, but the result of this led to the campy and just plain boring 4th episode.\n\nBut I really was surprised at how psychological of a movie Batman Forever is. I'm not saying it's particularly deep, but when you look at Edward Nygma's obsession with Bruce Wayne (stalking him, to imitating him right down to the mole), Harvey Dent's schizophrenia as Two-Face, and the fact that both Bruce Wayne AND Batman end up romancing the same psychologist is all enormously amusing. The romance isn't to be taken that lightly, though. I thought out of all 5 films Chase Meridian was Bruce's best girlfriend. The whole Vicky Vale relationship was pretty stale if you cut out all of the conflict with the Joker, and obviously Selina Kyle didn't work out so well for Bruce. Having this woman who could understand the mind of the tortured Bruce Wayne was a great idea, and I don't need to tell you that the gorgeous and talented Nicole Kidman pulled it off well.\n\nSomething I liked (and would have liked to have seen more of) was the competitive relationship between Bruce Wayne and Edward Nygma. They're enemies as Batman and The Riddler but also as regular people in everyday life. Take that scene at the Nygmatec Ball when Edward gloats about how well off he is, but Bruce is totally unflinching. Jim Carrey does a great job with a character that is so obsessed with this person; who idolizes him but hates him at the same time and is generally evil, but still can make us fall on the floor laughing.\n\nThis is a rousing and dynamic picture. It's basically the lighter side of being Batman. It was exciting with some great action sequences: I loved the end where both Robin and Chase are dropped and he saves them both. That piece of Elliot Goldenthal music when Batman finally grasps Robin's arm is excellent.\n\nI liked Burton's 2 films and obviously Batman Begins better than Forever, but when you're in the right mood for it, it really is a fantastic movie that, if nothing else, thoroughly entertains.\n\nMy rating: 7/10",

Batman) has a new nemesis in the shape of Two Face (Tommy Lee Jones) a homicidal psychopath who was once a noble lawyer, only for his face and mind to be hideously deformed after a substance was thrown over him in a courtroom. But he's soon to be joined by another: The Riddler (Jim Carrey) who was a former scientist at Wayne Enterprises and had his ideas rejected by those in power. Whilst dealing with all of this, he entertains a romance with the beautiful psychologist Dr Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman) and takes a boy acrobat under his wing whose family were murdered in a hesit by Two-Face, who will come to be known as Robin, the fateful sidekick...\n\nIn my Batman Begins review, I stated how it was 'Batman for a new generation.' Yet ten years ago I suppose you could say the same thing was happening to the Batman franchise. It was a whole new Batman, with a lighter, sillier, more family friendly appeal to it, with a new actor playing Batman in the shape of Val Kilmer and a new hack director in the shape of Joel Schumacher, after Tim Burton had left to pursue greater things such as The Nightmare Before Christmas (although he does take over producing duties here.) I suppose it is all really a question of whether you prefer the dark or the light versions of Batman. But I know which camp I'm settled in.\n\nThere is a lot of light and flashy effects in this one, but it is completely empty. The story is uninvolving, the characters naff and the acting poor. For starters, there's the impossibly wooden O' Donnell, who wouldn't go on to improve in any of his future projects and is at his worst here, and also in one scene zooms down a road in the Batmobile (which he's souped up!) to which a flock of girls crowd round it, which I think played a part in kick-starting the whole vacuous 'chav' craze, as well as Batman's subliminal messaging at the beginning with the line 'it's the car, right, chicks dig the car', when in fact ten years later, a whole string of Brian Harvey-alikes would be 'digging' the car. In the villain roles, Carrey can either make you laugh with his manic performances or he can severely get on your nerves, and that's definitely the case here and Jones can play a great villain and is trying his best here, but it's all just wasted on him. Kidman is very sexy as the love interest, but doesn't manage to contribute anything other than that. As Batman, I suppose Kilmer doesn't do anything Keaton didn't do but, like I said, I'll stay a Keaton man...\n\nI suppose a lot of it really depends on whether you're a dark Batman fan or a light Batman fan and I suppose Returns might just hold a bit of sentimental value for me, but, all the same, hats off to this, my personal least favourite of the series. **",

        "reviewText": "Among the four pre-Dark Knight films of Christopher Nolan, I'd say that this one was the most suitable for my tastes. Note I didn't say 'favorite', because in general, these films are on a seriously lower grade level than the Dark Knight pictures. I guess for me, this story at least had some character development missing in the prior two pictures, as in the exploration of Bruce Wayne/Batman's (Val Kilmer) duality and the story of Robin's (Chris O'Donnell) origin. Batman's conflict was given added weight with the presence of Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman), a psychologist who found herself in a similar conflict over which one to choose as a romantic interest. There was an interesting scene where Wayne walked right into an unset trap by seeing a bat in a Rorschach drawing. That was a revelation for both Bruce and the shrink.\n\nAs far as villains go, I think the franchise would have been better off by introducing one bad guy at a time instead of two or three as in \"Batman and Robin\", because the story seems to get watered down when the hero has to concentrate on multiple enemies. You generally didn't find that to be the case in the comics, but I understand that the film makers were probably trying to get the biggest bang for the buck with their casting choices.\n\nSo with that in mind, Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey were two hot names at the time, and were generally suitable picks for their respective alter-egos, Two-Face and The Riddler. Quite honestly, I didn't discern much difference between Jones's Two-Face and Nicholson's Joker, almost opposite sides of the same coin if you catch the irony. With the Riddler, you have Carrey doing himself most of the time, whether in character or not; that's one of the things I find annoying about him when appearing on a talk show. He feels he needs to be over the top most of the time, just like the Riddler when he posed the same question.\n\nWell fortunately I guess, this series of films is a couple of decades in the past now and I think of them now more as curiosity pieces than part of the Batman comics continuity. Somewhat, but on a different level than the Adam West TV series, which also produced it's share of groan inducing moments. At least these flicks didn't accentuate the action with Pow! Smash! Boom! word balloons.",

        "reviewText": "Batman Forever is easily one of the more enjoyable superhero movies ever produced in my opinion. It has a perfect balance of comedy, drama, action and adventure, and romance to satisfy pretty much any film enthusiasts. Even though this film had its quirks, especially from a Batman fan's point of view, this Bat-Film is just overall too much fun to let those itty bitty problems bother you.\n\nBatman Forever is the continuing story of Bruce Wayne (in this film played by Val Kilmer) continuing his conquest of ridding Gotham City's criminal underworld of crime to avenge his parents as the mysterious hero, Batman. The film follows two of Batman's most notorious villains, Riddler and Two-Face (played by Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones, respectively), the two hatch a plot to steal mind waves from unsuspecting citizens of the world, and use the information from their minds to get access to deep, dark secrets and other high profile things like bank codes and such. Yes, their plan sounds kind of out there, but it really doesn't play too much into the overall story of the film, it is really just a reason for Batman to show up at the end and beat up the bad guys. The bulk of the story is about Batman having a romance with the beautiful Dr. Chase Meridian (played by Nicole Kidman), and his growing relationship with this young man from a Circus who saw his parents murdered in front of him, this man is named Dick Grayson (played by Chris O' Donnell).\n\nThis film is often considered by many Batman fans to of been the point where the Batman film franchise began to go down hill, and I must say I couldn't disagree more. This film is fairly true to the 1940s roots of the comics, where Batman wasn't an all out camp fest like he was in the 60s, but wasn't entirely at all realistic like it is now in the comics, allowing this film to have more fun. The creativeness of the city of Gotham in this film is amazing and spectacular, it is truly one of the finer interpretations of Gotham ever put on film. Another thing that is truly worth mention in this particular movie are the action sequences, each one scripted to perfection, this particular Batman film being really the only one that successfully portrayed Batman as a hero and not an anti-hero, which once again many hate that part of this one, but I personally don't mind it, it allows for much more entertaining escapism. The best part of this film though was Jim Carrey as the Riddler, his high octane performance never has a weak moment, and he keeps the laughs coming while still being a sick and twisted villain. The other cast members were really great as well, but Jim Carrey just really stole each scene he was in from the other actors.\n\nOverall, this is easily the most crowd pleasing Batman film of them all, and it is a joy to watch from beginning to end. The only minor things that get on my nerves are the annoying Batnipples on the Batsuit in like the last twenty minutes of the film, but since it is only twenty minutes of them, I can take it.\n\nI give Batman Forever a fun and entertaining 10 out of 10!",

        "reviewText": "After Tim Burton, it is Joel Schumacher's turn to take over to shot the third chapter of the adventures of Batman. This change of director deals a serious blow to the quality of the whole in the way it marks a sharp regression in comparison with the two previous Batman movies.\n\nWe can say that to write this third opus, the authors have made a minimum of effort. The screenplay is largely inspired of Tim Burton's movies. In \"Batman Returns\" (1992), the Penguin and Catwoman joined forces to fight the hero of Gotham City. Here, the Mystery Man and Mr Heads or Tails dare to pit themselves against Batman. Then, Schumacher tried to find room in the script to focus on Bruce Wayne's personality and his psychology strongly echoes to the type of character developed by Burton in the first movie. We knew that Bruce Wayne was an ambiguous character, haunted by bad memories (his parents' death). Here, we learn that it is this tragic event that made him want to create a second identity for himself in order to fight evil and make justice triumph. But we could have guessed this intention from the first movie. As a matter of fact, Schumacher openly shows what we thought about the reasons that drive Wayne to become Batman. So the sequences during which we see Val Kilmer anguished by seeing certain objects only constitute a pointless digression in the long run. It is only of minor interest.\n\n\"Batman Forever\" also contains a simplistic and thin plot which the director does his best to highlight it by opting for the spectacular. There are action sequences which run well but sometimes they nearly verge on the ludicrous.\n\nOn another hand, the darkness that shrouded Gotham City has vanished. So, the threatening aspect of the city has virtually disappeared.\n\nAbout the cast, it alternates the best and the worst. Val Kilmer puts on quite easily the Batman outfit (Michael Keaton turned down the role in spite of an attractive price) but Chris O'Donnell beside him is rather colorless. About the wicked, well Jim Carrey was the most appropriate actor to act the Mystery Man and so he fulfilled well his part. But I found Tommy Lee Jones unbearable.\n\nA quite indigestible film where Schumacher unlike Tim Burton shows his inability in developing his own vision of Batman and contents himself with making a tailor-made movie for the top of the box-office.",

After Batman Returns I didn't know how much more decadent they could get, with so much lack of lighting I was having a hard time just WATCHING the movies. As far as Batman himself I am happy to say that Val Kilmer is NOT Michael Keaton or Adam West.  They were ok for the job but were just too wooden and monolithic for their actions.  With Kilmer we get a much more fluid Batman who doesn't seem to lag around like Keaton's did.  Speed is what he does best...and he does it! The supporting protagonists do the meager, ok job they need to keep this film acceptable.  It is nice to see Dick Grayson ditch that sickeningly awful \"Robin\" outfit a la 1966 and get a REAL superhero suit. THE VILLAINS! No Batman movie would be complete without them!  Tommy Lee Jones is ok as Two-Face and his presence holds on until Jim Carrey--master of dancing around and acting like the modern, much cooler Jerry Lewis--slides in as the Riddler.  Like Nicholson in the first, Carrey holds our attention with his shenanigans (even if they annoy us) and make the movie a bit more fun. That's the whole point.  When we go to a Batman movie, we aren't expecting \"The Godfather\" or \"Citizen Kane\".  We want to be entertained to the MAX and this movie does just that with a hint of glitz and a lot more style than Batman 2 did.  Remember how it took over half an hour for us to get around to observing Keaton as Bruce Wayne in that one?  I think these two are tied for second. By all means avoid Batman & Robin!  You will be utterly disappointed with George \"ER\" Clooney, Arnold \"Jingle all the Way\" Scwarzenegger, Uma \"the Avengers\" Thurman, and everything else in that piece of garbage.",

Burton is an amazing director and brought the best out of Keaton(when batman was out he became the coolest man around - and now he's not even given an eyelid!).\n\nSo what went wrong with this film.  Was is Schumacher?  Apparantly Keaton had doubts over wanting to do another Batman movie and after meeting Schumacher dropped out.  It is amazing that such an actor can be put off a film such as this.  But after seeing the film I can see why.\n\nThe film starts off pretty well, a helicopter crash into a statue of libery look-a-like - with Batman trapped inside, struggling to get outside before it crashed and blew up - it kinda took me back to old James Bond movies. The background song \"Kiss from a Rose\" provided by Seal is romantically well placed - but it isn't in the same OTT style as the film - unlike the U2 version.\n\nThe film lacks anything other than a flimsy plot of revenge.  Batman (played by a boring, Val Kilmer) plays master to a vengeful Robin who wants revenge on a flat villan, Two-Face (underplayed by Tommy Lee Jones), who is working with the Riddler - played by an OTT Jim Carrey (I personally would have gone for Robin Williams, but I guess Williams is too old - he's probably fits \"the Mad Hatter\" rather than the Riddler).\n\nI know Carrey was payed MegaBucks to carry this flimsy film, but this is no reason to make him the only star of this film.  Why, when Carrey gets all the minds off tv-zombies, doesn't realize Batman's true identity sooner is beyond me.\n\nCarrey's character is never explained properly, why is eccentric?  OK - he never got praise for his work, but if you didn't get praise for your job you don't come crazy and wear green spandex overnight do you?\n\nThis film is pretty poor compared to the previous versions, Nicole Kidman although looking pretty - figures out Batman's true identity far too quickly.  She's supposed to be head strong, but instead comes across as a dasmel in distress.\n\nOverall I suggest you return to the old versions.  And I would suggest avoiding the PAINFUL Clooney version: Batman and Robin.\n\nOverall: 4/10",

The Alien series is the best example, but the first Star Wars film differed radically as well. Now to Batman.\n\nThe Batman story always was a matter of dueling identities: Bruce Wayne's alter ego was a matter of dark pathology rather than say Superman's scrubbed crusader. The subterranean hideout, the night crawler, the unsettled angst, the matter of revenge characterize the work. Tim Burton missed with the first film, and ended up with eyewash pasted on characters, mostly Nicholson. But he made up for in Batman returns: there he had three characters (Batman, Penguin, Catwoman) living in split worlds, and each of the splits had a physical architecture. Its a pretty good example of folding internal conflict onto an external world for us to see.\n\nHaving mastered the problem, Burton moved on and passed the franchise to a decidedly less intelligent team. They completely lacked the ability to invest the conflict in the built environment and fell back on putting it into the story, so turns the environment into Sunday comics. So we have Two-face, who literally wears his duality, and the Riddler who lives in two worlds: that of the film and in the `between' space of the viewer and the film, where he intends to spoof us with his puzzling magic. (It's the same space similarly used in `Spy Kids' `Rocky and Bullwinkle.')\n\nThere was also a long story about Bruce's split mind, which gave the excuse to Kidman's role as psychologist. Lot's of haunting conflict both ways, both sides of Bruce using `Chase' (note the name) `Meridian' (dividing line) as both lover and analyst. But all that stuff was cut, including establishing shots at the asylum.\n\nThe result is two silly villains who don't have a world to live in as did Penguin and Catwoman. We have Kidman cut adrift with only a Jessica Rabbit imitation to work with. (Note: Kidman's natural red hair was made blond so that Carrey could get the red.) None of the three can possibly act under these conditions, though one of them (Kidman) is a fine actor.\n\nOne nice architectural feature remains: the Riddler's shaft which is the setting of the entire last act. The designer really had a powerful idea here, and some of it shines through the thuggish direction.\n\nTed's Evaluation -- 1 of 4: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",

Perhaps they had just gotten over the 60's series, too... and that one at least had the excuse that Batman hadn't really been done before that point. This follows a good film, and one that came close to being that, and, well, from the first lines, you can tell that this can by no means be considered as proper an approach as either of those. This film answered a once big question; would you rather never see your hero, your idol, in a film, or only see him or her done right? Burton got out of the director's chair when he found that his dark, and far more fitting, style of doing these films was not what the studio intended for future entries, and, presumably because he's cheap and easy to rely on for the producers, not making a fuss, Joel Schumacher was brought in. Everything proceeds to disintegrate. The bleak Gotham gains bright, tawdry neon, oh how the production team who created the architecture of the city in the first two must feel. The characterization is turned into superficial moments and lines of dialog. It's clear that Schumacher neither understands nor respects the medium of comic books; S1m0ne, by Andrew Niccol, goes too far in trying to make us laugh at celebrities and those at home who love them, but at least his production does hold truth and satire. We fans, we read comic books, is what we need really more people telling us how stupid they think that is? The presentation of the villains further illustrates it. Two-Face is essentially the Joker, just with only half a face of make-up. Where Nicholson was haunting and grotesque, Lee, in spite of being a very talented actor who I like and respect, and enjoy the work of, merely comes off as a nuisance, not a real threat. A cartoon. The utter lack of respect for the source material is seen in one brief part, mentioned in the Trivia section, where the character does something that not only is inconsistent, but downright goes straight against the very *core* of the personality of him! The Riddler is possibly even worse. I like Carrey, too... he's the very reason I initially watched it. Heck, these actors are almost all talented, only you wouldn't know it from watching this. The acting is overdone. Heck, everything is! Sequences are pushed to the extremes, with far too many colors and too much going on at once. The once well-written dialog is replaced with pitiful one-liners and such. Robin is introduced to this series of Batman, and he's made hip. See the earring? And just look at him hanging up the laundry! What were they *thinking*? The nipples on the suits even bothered Bob Kane himself. The action isn't even particularly exciting. It's such a shame that this actually had potential; there's back-story, motivation and explanation behind the title character, and the original plot(described elsewhere, it might spoil stuff in the film to reveal it here) sounds interesting. The worst may be that on the surface, this doesn't look anywhere near as awful as it is... it is a technically speaking fairly well-done film. Camera, editing and sound are by no means inspiring, but we *are* talking about Schumacher, here. They get the job done, he gets the job done, that's why the producers like him, that's why he keeps getting work. The effects vary, but many are good. There are a few references that aren't bad. I recommend this only to those who aren't fans. I don't know that I would have made it all the way through this and it's even worse follow-up had I been. As for who will enjoy it... that is a good question. If you're looking for parody, Black Scorpion is really better. 5/10",

But Batman is growing tired of his nightly parade as Batman and daily existence as the rich and powerful Bruce Wayne. He is haunted by memories of his parent's death and begins to remember details that he didn't before.\n\nTwo Face, a psycho killer who blames Batman for his scarred split face, teams up with The Riddler, an ex-employee of Bruce Wayne Enterprises, who was refused a partnership by Wayne, as his invention is very dangerous. Bruce/ Batman is thrown into contact with the beautiful Dr. Chase Meridian who is in Gotham to review the case of Two Face. A romance develops between the two, as Chase desires both Bruce and Batman, unaware that they are the same person. Bruce desires Chase more than anyone, knowing that she understands the human mind better than anyone else. He asks her to the Charity Circus that he is invited to with the other elite of Gotham. But the event is crashed when Two Face and his thugs also decide to attend uninvited. A family of acrobats are killed by Two Face, leaving only the youngest son, Dick \"Robin\" Grayson, alive and thirsting for revenge against Two Face.\n\nTaken in by Wayne, he soon discovers Bruce's carefully hidden alter-ego, Batman and takes the Batmobile on a spin, interrupting a date between Chase and Bruce. He begs Bruce to allow him to be his partner when they finally return to the Bat Cave. Alfred, the elderly butler, refuses to spurn Dick's need for revenge, telling Bruce that once he was like that too.\n\nMeanwhile, an entrepreneur calling himself Edward Nygma, who is actually Two Face's new accomplice The Riddler, is growing more and more rich, powerful and famous because of his invention of a new 3-D way of watching T.V. But he is in fact sucking all the secrets from the citizens of Gotham and growing extremely intelligent. He is gunning for Bruce as well as Batman and discovers that they are they same person. Soon the two villains are up against the newly formed partnership between Batman and Robin. When Chase is kidnapped by the evil pair, Batman and Robin go to The Riddler and Two Face's hideout on a metal-fabricated artificial island, after Alfred and Bruce manage to crack the riddles that The Riddler has been leaving him and they discover that Edward Nygma is the green clad villain.\n\nIn the end Batman is faced with the decision to save either Chase or Robin from the jagged rocks in a pit that they are suspended over by The Riddler. He tricks The Riddler however and breaks the giant hourglass structure that contains all the stored brainwaves of the citizens of Gotham. He saves both Chase and Robin, and uses Two Face's coin to kill the madman, by throwing a multitude of coins instead of only Two Face's special one. Robin understands that it is better that he didn't kill Two Face, agreeing with Bruce that such a crime is far too much too bear. At the end Edward claims that he is Batman, flapping the sleeves of his straight jacket in a grotesque imitation a bat's wings, cackling as Chase makes her way back outside of the lunatic asylum and informs Bruce that no one will ever know he is Batman. She leaves Gotham, never to see our secretive shadow destined hero ever again. Batman and Robin are now partners and the dark knight is indeed always going to the protector of the Gothic metropolis of Gotham."

Fortunately, you do NOT need to be a Batmaniac in order to enjoy the movie, as a dopey old man like myself still got a lot out of the film. As for me, I was thrilled to see a Batman Lego movie, as in \"The Lego Movie\" this character was my favorite. Here, he's back...as broody and aloof as ever.\n\nThe plot is pretty simple. The Joker is angry that Batman doesn't care about him nor does he see him as his personal nemesis. So, the Joker is out to hurt Batman by unleashing all sorts of wicked creatures on Gotham City. As for Batman, the self-centered jerk superhero learns to rely on others...starting with Dick Grayson, Barbara Gordon and Alfred.\n\nThis is pretty much what you'd expect from the film...one that kids will no doubt enjoy and adults will enjoy or at least tolerate. To me, the best kids films are the ones with wide appeal....and it's hard to imagine anyone not liking this cute film.",

Batman must also deal with his loneliness, feelings, and being honest with himself. Ralph Fiennes voices Alfred and not Voldemort...how bad was that for a miscast. \n\nI loved how the film satirizes the many aspects of Batman and superhero movies in general. Great script.",

Just replace the word \"hate\" with \"love\" and it's a rom-com between the two with batman refusing to commit and Joker feeling like his \"hate\" was only one sided and he deserves better, Hilarious!!!\n\nThey actually reference all of batman from the silly TV show of the 60's, the bam and kapow that pop up in the comics when he hits someone, his dark night trilogy, you name it it's there... and sometimes they'd even play some footage!\n\nIf you know anything, really anything at all about batman then I'd recommend you watch this movie. age doesn't matter. The one flaw I could think of was how fast this was going with the jokes, at times I wish it would slow down because another one comes in before I was even done laughing at the previous joke.\n\n10/10 and yay for parody not being dead!",

        "reviewText": "Was very pleasantly surprised by 'The LEGO Movie'. Initially wasn't sure as to whether a film based on a popular (and timeless) children's toy merchandise would work, but it ended up being one of the best animated films that year and one of the year's most entertaining.\n\n'The LEGO Batman Movie' was seen with higher expectations, knowing what to expect and being somebody who likes Batman very much, and was every bit as good if not better. Its only stumbling block is the last half hour or so, which tonally (with things taking a more dramatic and darker tone) felt too far removed from the rest of the film and not only did it lose momentum it also felt somewhat overblown. With that being said, 'The LEGO Batman Movie' was a sheer delight for Batman and superhero fans, anybody who loved 'The LEGO Movie' and wants to see a fresh take on Batman and superheroes will not be disappointed.\n\nLike with 'The LEGO Movie', the animation is really first rate, the vibrant yet dynamic colours are remarkably vivid to the extent that it makes the eyes pop, the backgrounds are immaculately designed, the characters look remarkably good in Lego form and a lot of the visuals especially in the action are very inventive. There is a bright and breezy soundtrack that compliments The Lego Movie beautifully, a lot of it is very catchy with a touch of humour while also giving room for a more understated touch.\n\nAgain, the script bursts with imaginative verbal and visual gags, while there is a sharp wit, snappy dialogue and thick and fast jokes that all hit their mark. A lot of it is hilarious and makes the film one of 2017's most entertaining, but it's more than just comedy. There is a lot of poignant heart, block-busting action and some inspirational messaging. What makes 'The LEGO Batman Movie' especially good is how it feels like a celebration of Batman while mocking previous incarnations and his origins with glee.\n\nStory is fast-paced and energetic, with lots of humour and heart. There are a lot of characters here but not too many, the characters (heroes and villains) have their entertaining quirks and personalities yet the film really allows you to properly care for them as well. The voice work is exemplary, with note perfect turns from Will Arnett and Ralph Fiennes and actors who on paper sounded completely wrong for their roles actually nailing them (Zach Galifianakis could easily have been a disaster as Joker but was both entertaining and menacing, Michael Cera is also the most likable he has been in a long time).\n\nIn summary, wonderful, perfect for kids and adults alike and a delight for Batman/superhero fans. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Just like the movie before it, the LEGO Batman movie surprises yet again with a fun piece of imaginative work. It has the humor, the action, the animation, and surprisingly again the heart. We thought to ourselves a Lego movie would never work, it sounds like the ultimate marketing sham Hollywood could ever put out to sell toys, but it became one my favorite animated films of all time why? The first movie blew me away because it not only worked as a story, but it encompassed everything a fan of Lego remembers. In a similar fashion, this movie encompassed everything you know about Batman, and I mean everything. I swear there was almost a reference to everything you remember about him, from Detective Comics all the way to Batfleck. It sounds like I'm talking about fan service because yes, it is most of the time. They use it to their advantage here, they praise and mock everything great, and everything terrible Batman has gone through over the years. You almost miss too much because they cram so many funny nod ons and jokes you wish they had spread em out a little bit. But In other words, the script is a hilarious tribute to arguably one of the greatest superheroes of all time, and surprisingly the most emotional. The focus of the film actually deals with to me a critical factor of Batman. His isolation and loneliness, his fear of becoming part of a family again. The special relationship Batman has with the Joker. It hits all the emotional beats just right with all of its themes. It utilizes it's imagination of Legos to it's potential. And it produces a fantastic message for kids, as well as a touching tribute to fans of Batman. Seriously this movie had a smile on my face except for the parts when it really hit home for me. It also makes me mad, because the film proves that WB is just sitting on a character's pile of good material to work with, and they don't know what to do with them in their real films. This movie has such a stronger emotional impact than anything the DC cinematic universe has done with its last three films. It doesn't mean DC has to sell to Disney, it doesn't mean critics are biased against DC. It just means when you get people who know the material well, they're gonna make it a great film if they know what to do with it. That's what's happening here, if WB can take notes and study why this movie really works, maybe the Justice League and Ben Affleck's Batman film will actually make a better impact? Regardless, this is the standard animated movies need to have outside of Disney, and WB really needs to bring the heart this movie has into their live action films. If you love Legos and Batman what are you waiting for?? Go now!! You don't even have to take a kid, it's a total blast for all ages, and I will definitely be seeing it again real soon.",

The kids see Lego's with colors, action and subtle lines they understand, but children are more focused on the action and not dialogue. For adults, it is full of Innuendos that keep you laughing non stop. I literally cried from laughing so hard. \n\nSo if a movie for a family is entertaining for the kids and makes adults laugh and not look at watch to see \"when this is over\", then that's a 10.

        "reviewText": "Growing up, Lego meant everything to me, my aspirations of becoming an architect, and even the result of me studying design engineering in university, were all due to my fascination with Lego as a child and the complex structures you could craft and create. In 2014, upon the announcement of 'The Lego Movie', despite my love for the toy, I was kinda doubting the general premise. How could you make a movie out of Lego? Well, that question was soon answered as I gawped in awe at the screen, the movie was fantastic. Now, the character from 'The Lego Movie'' that garnered the most love was Batman, a cocky, sarcastic, childish take on the superhero we know and love... well it was only going to be a matter of time before he got his own motion picture.\n\n'The Lego Batman Movie' was definitely an enjoyable ride, and whilst I think it lacks in comparison to its predecessor, it stills thrusts us back into the universe that we came to revere in 2014. With an admirable cast of voice talent, and stunning animated visuals, 'The Lego Batman Movie' boasts undeniable creative talent, but does at times seem to be trying a little too hard to be funny, building off the reputation the initial film garnered.\n\nIs this film worth viewing? Most definitely, it's a hilarious feel- good animated comedy, and definitely perfect for the younger audience. I actually saw this film prior to its full release during a preview a few days early, however I believe it may have been aimed more as a kids matin√©e... I was literally the only adult there, shameful I know, but heck, I didn't care. The kids in the audience continually laughed with glee, so its definitely something suited for that kind of audience, but don't skip over the older adults who are still children at heart, it's an alluring comedy that piles on the laughs, definitely worth a watch.",

        "reviewText": "In 2014, we became acquainted with an ignorant but arrogant billionaire with orange hair who wanted to rule the world. Call him President Business. Well, that's what they called him in \"The Lego Movie\". (What? Who did you think I was talking about?) The process of defeating that cartoonish villain involved joining together a vast array of different characters who had to learn to put aside their differences and work together to wrest power from that evil businessman-turned-politician. (Yes, of course I'm still talking about the first Lego movie.) All this may sound scary, but the animated feature film that I've been describing since the very beginning of this paragraph had some important lessons to teach about teamwork and the specialness of all people ‚Äì whether they're made out of plastic or just look and act plastic on screen. Ignorant arrogance like this can also be very funny (as long as it's fictional) and \"The Lego Movie\" delivered on that promise. Doubling down on that kind of humor is that movie's 2017 spin-off \"The Lego Batman Movie\" (PG, 1:44), an inspired mashup of Danish toys and American comic books.\n\nTo simply say that Lego Batman is a loner is like referring to the Unabomber as anti-social. Batman / Bruce Wayne (voiced by Will Arnett) lives in Wayne Manor with his devoted butler and father figure Alfred (Ralph Fiennes), but still chooses to spend all his time alone, watching movies or staring wistfully at a photo of him with his long-dead parents. Even when he's in public (whether as Batman or as Bruce Wayne), he treats the citizens of Gotham as his subjects and only wants their adulation. Batman gives himself full credit for keeping Gotham crime-free and is convinced that he's the only one who can do it ‚Äì and that he doesn't need help or advice from anyone. This Batman probably thinks that the first film's Oscar-nominated original song \"Everything is Awesome\" was written for and about him and his life. (The character could have also written the film's tagline: \"Always be yourself. Unless you can be Batman.\") A high-class gala thrown to honor the retiring Commissioner Gordon turns out to be an extremely consequential gathering. As Bruce Wayne struts through the crowd, the original Commissioner Gordon's daughter, Barbara (Rosario Dawson), who is taking over for her father, begins making a speech in which she calls for the police to work more closely with Batman ‚Äì as a team (an idea which makes him spit out his drink) ‚Äì and to limit Batman's autonomy (think, the setup for \"Captain America: Civil War\"). Just then, the Joker (Zach Galifianakis) shows up. The day before, as Batman was foiling the Joker's latest plan to take over the city, the two argued about how important they are in each other's lives. When Batman refused to admit that the Joker is his main nemesis (saying, \"I fight with a lot of people. I like to fight around.\"), the Joker's feelings were hurt. Now, at the gala, Joker suddenly switches tactics. He surrenders to the new Commissioner Gordon, confesses to his crimes and asks to be sent to prison. Oh, and earlier at this same gala, Wayne accidentally adopts young orphan Dick Grayson (Michael Cera).\n\nBatman decides that the Joker is up to something, but he's not sure what it is, so he comes up with a plan to get rid of him for good. Batman includes his new ward Dick Grayson (now called Robin) because he considers Dick expendable. The two of them go to Superman's Fortress of Solitude where they see Superman throwing a party for the rest of the Justice League's super angular superheroes. Nevertheless, Batman takes advantage of his fellow heroes being distracted by the party to steal Superman's Phantom Zone projector so he can send the Joker into the Phantom Zone. The problem with that plan is that it would put the Joker in the company of some of the world's greatest villains, a situation which could end up unleashing untold evil on the world, and forcing Batman to enlist the help of his fellow members of the Justice League (and others) as he confronts his biggest challenge ever. Just don't expect Batman's ego to go quietly into the sunset (or the Bat Signal) ‚Äì or for the Joker to be so easily defeated.\n\n\"The Lego Batman\" movie is an inspired and extremely enjoyable crossover between Lego's growing animation efforts and established DC Comics characters¬Ö plus a long and diverse list of others. The plot makes full use of the potential inherent in combining such diverse and storied properties ‚Äì and effectively builds upon what made the first Lego movie so popular. The script (which combines the efforts of five different writers), along with Chris McKay's direction is both funny and just plain fun, a lot of that due to the juxtaposition of Batman's self-centered intensity with Robin's innocent earnestness. All of the voice work is top-notch, but Will Arnett's ignorant arrogance as Batman is really what makes the movie. He's as humorous as any of Will Farrell's similarly pompous live action characters (e.g., as Ron Burgundy in the \"Anchorman\" movies or as race car driver Ricky Bobby in \"Talladega Nights\") and ‚Äìwhether intentionally or not ‚Äì reminds us of the attitudes, words and conduct of some American politicians. This Lego movie is even better than the original and leaves me anxious for what's next. \"A-\"",

        "reviewText": "Let's be honest for a second and agree that The Lego Movie should never have worked. On paper, it's a horrible idea. Yet, Phil Lord and Chris Miller did what they always do - take a strange and unwieldy idea and turn it into something great. Including Batman in The Lego Movie seemed a bizarre choice, but the Will Arnett voiced character was a highlight for pretty much everyone who watched it and it didn't take long until a spin off was announced. With Lord and Miller only serving as producers this time, the satisfaction of The Lego Movie wore off and we were all sceptical about whether the spin off was a good idea. It turns out that, just like last time, we never needed to worry at all.\n\nWhen he isn't fighting crime as masked vigilante Batman, Bruce Wayne (Arnett) lives in recluse in his mansion with his butler Alfred (Ralph Fiennes). His arch nemesis, the Joker (Zach Galifianakis), rallies together an endless group of villains to attempt to rid Gotham City of the Batman, all while new Police Chief Barbara Gordon (Rosario Dawson) proposes that Batman abandon his solo nature and work alongside the law enforcement. After a misunderstanding, Wayne also accidentally adopts local orphan Dick Grayson (Michael Cera), who he reluctantly takes on as a prot√©g√©. Eventually, it is down to Batman, Grayson, Gordon and Alfred to battle the Joker and save Gotham City.\n\nIf it sounds kind of mental, it's because it is. If you thought The Lego Movie was high octane and relied on energy, it pales in comparison to The Lego Batman Movie. But, once again, here we have a film that is not only zany and energetic but also consistently funny, mindbogglingly inventive, nimbly structured and genuinely touching. While it loses the surprise effect that made The Lego Movie such a treat and its conclusion doesn't rival the sudden foray into live action that made its parent film so poignant, Lego Batman remains a highly enjoyable film that puts a smile on your face from beginning to end.\n\nI would comfortably say that this is a funnier film than The Lego Movie. The jokes come thick and fast, a large percentage of the film is more than prepared to drop at least three jokes per minute and they all land. There are digs at other recent Batman stories - most notably Suicide Squad and Batman v Superman, obviously - and multiple other references to other films, but Lego Batman even finds room for more adult humour (how the number plate on Bruce Wayne's car made it into the final cut is hilariously baffling to me) and countless sight gags. The faux stop motion animation style carves the way for some brilliant little visual flourishes that add depth to the film's comedy - it isn't just content to run one joke into the ground, rather it consistently finds new comedic territory and makes every joke its own.\n\nThe way Lego Batman even lands on something genuinely moving in its finale is even more impressive. You could make a case for the film's central theme being a bit obvious when it comes to Batman - the whole film is pegged around isolation and loneliness and how you combat that to form a human relationship of any kind - but it handles it excellently. It's written smartly enough to simultaneously act as a life lesson for small kids as well as a powerful sentiment to older viewers. The fact that it has a better grasp of Batman as a character than Batman v Superman did isn't exactly surprising, but what is surprising is just how committed to this theme the film really is.\n\nIt doesn't just form it around Batman. Young Dick Grayson feels the same emotional distance, Barbara Gordon only wants to do well in her first challenge as the new Police Chief, Alfred wants to help his adoptive son refocus his life and even the Joker just wants to comfortably know that he really is Batman's arch nemesis. It all sounds silly, and of course it is, but Lego Batman excels whenever it combines the silly and the thoughtful. Thankfully, that's most of its run time. The voice acting is faultless all round, too. Arnett remains the obvious highlight for too many reasons than can be explained, but Michael Cera, Ralph Fiennes, Rosario Dawson, Jenny Slate, and Channing Tatum are all delightful as well.\n\nLego Batman's biggest triumph, though? It perfectly reminds us that the concept of a Lego Movie shouldn't put us off anymore. There have been weirder franchises in cinematic history, and while this sounded like one big cash grab from the word go, everything we have seen in this Universe so far has been terrific. Lego Batman loses that surprise element because about ten minutes into the film you stop worrying, you just know you're going to have a blast. I mean, how could you not? The less said about a plethora of other characters who appear in the film's second half, the better - but it's hilarious and unique and wonderful all at once. If just one film drops in 2017 that's more fun than this, what a year it will be.\n\nTO SUMMARISE: Dazzlingly inventive and unrelentingly funny, The Lego Batman Movie adds another enjoyable and surprisingly moving entry to the ever impressive Lego Movie franchise.\n\nwww.morrismovies.co.uk",

Batman protects Gotham City from the Joker(Zach Galifianakis) & several other bad guys. He must also take care of Robin/Dick Grayson(Michael Cera), the young boy he adopted. The Joker comes up with his most deadly plan yet. Now, it is up to Batman with the help of his allies, to stop the Joker from executing his dastardly plan. \n\nThe LEGO Batman Movie is an amazing film. It is on par with The Lego Movie(2014). The animation is unique & flawless. It is fantastic how the animators over at Warner Animation Group, bring these Lego figurines & building blocks to life. The highlight of the movie, is how it references & pokes fun at all the previous big screen incarnations of Batman. The 3D immerses you into the proceedings on screen. This film is hilarious, with the one-liners being delivered by all the characters, non-stop. It also does justice to the sentimental aspects of Batman's story. Director Chris McKay has impeccably brought to life, a totally different kind of Batman. The actors who have lent their voices to the various characters, are spot on. Will Arnett is spectacular as Batman/Bruce Wayne. Michael Cera is adorable as Robin/Dick Grayson. Rosario Dawson is excellent as Batgirl/Barbara Gordon. Ralph Fiennes is superb as Alfred Pennyworth. Zach Galifianakis is outstanding as the Joker. Jenny Slate is awesome as Harley Quinn. Jason Mantzoukas, Conan O'Brien, Doug Benson, Billy Dee Williams, Zoe Kravitz, Kate Micucci, Riki Lindhome, Eddie Izzard, Seth Green, Jemaine Clement, Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill, Adam Devine, Hector Elizondo & Mariah Carey are brilliant in their cameos as Scarecrow, The Riddler, Bane, Two-Face, Catwoman, Clayface, Poison Ivy, Voldemort, King Kong, Sauron, Superman, Green Lantern, The Flash, Jim Gordon & Mayor McCaskill, respectively.

        "reviewText": "Wow, this movie surprised me. It was a lot better than the original Lego Movie and passed my expectations. It was hilarious in showing how arrogant and stuck-up Batman is and great throwbacks to the previous Batman films and the TV series from the 1960's with Adam West. The last four Batman movies are good, but they're very dark and dreary. This one is just flat-out fun. It spoofs the Batman mythology, but respects it at the same time. So far, this has been my favorite movie of 2017. \n\nBatman is the dark vigilante of Gotham City. After defeating the Joker yet again Batman hurts his feelings and tells him he means nothing to him. The Joker soon comes up with a new plan to bring Batman and Gotham to its knees. Batman will need the help of Robin, Alfred, Barbara Gordon and many others to defeat Joker's army of villains. The movie is much better than how I'm describing. It's hard to do so without spoiling all the great surprises and hilarious nods to other great films. If you love Batman, Superman, and the DC universe, you'll love THE LEGO BATMAN MOVIE!!!",

Chockful of fourth wall humor and tons of brick and mortar action, this movie features an all star cast of superheroes and villains, not to mention cameos from other franchises and classic Lego toys to make up for what's the longest of the Lego movies. There are some moments when the adults laugh a lot and there is kiddie humor as well. I highly recommend seeing this while it lasts in the theaters to get the full experience. I can't wait to see what the Lego Ninjago Movie has in store when it opens in the fall of this year!!!",

        "reviewText": "The Lego Movie was a massive success for brick lovers all over the world, and notable for the scene-stealing moments of the supporting superhero character, so it was almost inevitable he would get his own movie, being a both fan of the world's best-selling toy and the character I was most excited. Basically Batman (Will Arnett) saves Gotham City from another take-over attempt by the Joker (Zach Galifianakis) and a host of other famous and not so well known villains, but the hero hurts his arch-rival's feelings, he does not see him as his greatest enemy, he says it is Superman (Channing Tatum). The next day, as his alter ego Bruce Wayne, Batman attends the retirement celebration for Commissioner Jim Gordon (Hector Elizondo), his daughter Barbara Gordon (Rosario Dawson) is taking over the Gotham City Police Department, she announces her plans to restructure Gotham Police without the need for Batman, which infuriates him. Joker and all the Gotham City villains crash the party, but not to cause havoc, they surrender, making Batman realise that without crime to fight and villains to catch he is irrelevant. At the same time, Batman discovers he unintentionally adopted orphan Richard \"Dick\" Grayson (Michael Cera), his butler Alfred Pennyworth (Ralph Fiennes) convinces him to take Dick under his wing, after intentionally revealing the Batcave to the youngster. Batman takes Dick, as Robin, with him to find out what the Joker is really up to, he deduces he is plotting in Arkham Asylum, he sees banishing the Joker to the Phantom Zone is the only solution, so Batman and Robin travel to Superman's Fortress of Solitude to steal the Phantom Zone Projector. After taking the device, Batman and Robin rush to the asylum to zap the Joker into the dimensional prison, but Barbara locks them up for Batman's irrational behaviour. In the Phantom Zone, Joker meets a host of the greatest villains who have been banished, including the Lord Voldemort (Eddie Izzard), King Kong (Seth Green), Sauron (Jemaine Clement), Daleks and Gremlins, they are all released when Harley Quinn (Jenny Slate) steals the Phantom Zone Projector. With Gotham City in complete chaos, Batman reluctantly agrees to team up with Barbara, as Batgirl, along with Dick and also disguised Alfred, to stop the Joker and the villains from blowing up the city, with bombs stolen from the Batcave. Arriving at Wayne Island, Batman ditches Robin, Barbara and Alfred to face the Joker alone, but he is zapped into the Phantom Zone himself, there the gatekeeper Phyllis (Ellie Kemper) makes him realises his selfishness and arrogance is villainous behaviour, he makes a deal to bring all the villains back into the Phantom Zone, in exchange for returning to Gotham. Upon returning, Batman and his allies, along with the other Gotham villains who felt neglected by the Joker, battle the other villains and send them back to the Phantom Zone. But the bombs are detonated, causing Gotham City to be split in half by an earthquake, Batman reluctantly tells the Joker he is the most important person in his life, together they, his allies, his rogues gallery and the citizens chain link themselves to pull the city back together. With Gotham City saved, Batman prepares to return to the Phantom Zone as agreed with Phyllis, but he is rejected, Phyllis has seen the good in him, Batman allows the Joker and the others to escape, but Batman is confident they will be no match for the combined team of himself, Robin, Barbara and Alfred. Also starring Siri as 'Puter, Billy Dee Williams as Two-Face, Mariah Carey as Mayor McCaskill, Jonah Hill as Green Lantern, Conan O'Brien as The Riddler, Zo√´ Kravitz as Catwoman, Adam Devine as The Flash, Jason Mantzoukas as Scarecrow, Doug Benson as Bane, Kate Micucci as Clayface and Riki Lindhome as Poison Ivy. Arnett is a fantastic choice with his gravelly voice to play the egotistical crowd-pleaser, Cera is good as his excitable sidekick, Galifianakis is a perfectly energetic Joker, and the supporting cast including Fiennes and Dawson are great as well. The special effects animation to create the realistic Lego pieces and fast-paced action sequences are brilliant; the references to everything in the Batman world, from the Adam West camp Caped Crusader days to the Dark Knight and Batman v Superman era are fantastic; and the witty script, full of mocking and deliberately obvious puns work really well, there is something for both the kids and the grown-ups in this new spin-off and send up on the comic book based franchise, a most entertaining computer-animated superhero action comedy. Lego was number 1 on The 100 Greatest Toys, and Batman was number 84 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!",

        "reviewText": "I love the Lego Batman! And I love this movie! It is so good! The LEGO Movie is one of my favourite films, and The LEGO Batman Movie is just as good! Of course the universes are a bit different. The LEGO Movie is a mix of, well, every possible universe, while The LEGO Batman movie is mostly DC universe - with a mixture of different villains released by Joker. Also that certain meta feeling is not there, that was in The LEGO Movie, but that might've been good. The difference between the two is that The LEGO Movie was, in a way, about Legos. Now the characters in The LEGO Batman Movie are made of legos, sure, so are buildings and all that, but it's not addressed so much. We don't have to think about it. It could be just another superhero movie, apart from few jokes that require Legos. \n\nThis was so much fun! Since I obviously went to see this in English (and since the subtitles didn't work), the audience was mostly grown ups, and every one of us was laughing. And there were so many kind of jokes. One of my favourites is Batman saying it would be stupid to have villains fight villains.\n\nAnd of course The LEGO Batman Movie isn't just action and fun, even though that would've worked too. There's some pretty deep and important stuff about Bruce getting over his fear of intimacy and all that. Of course all that is kind of sappy, but hey, when isn't stuff like that sappy? It's still really nice to see Bruce Wayne / Batman actually have more character development in The LEGO Batman Movie than in the whole Nolan trilogy. Also there are probably a lot of adults out there who might actually see their own issues in Bruce Wayne, who is not going to just be dark brooding Batman and never let anyone close. And also I mean it gives children a nice lesson about family as well. Altogether all the life lessons in The LEGO Batman Movie were so nice, and even if they were sappy, even someone with cynic's traits might melt a bit. I know I did.\n\nRight now I can't think of anything wrong with this movie. It was a great experience! It has the best parts of a children's movie and a superhero movie. It's an excellent movie, better than any other Batman movie, and the only Batman movie I've given a full 10/10.",

        "reviewText": "'THE LEGO BATMAN MOVIE': Five Stars (Out of Five)\n\nA spin-off to 2014's blockbuster computer-animated hit 'THE LEGO MOVIE', focusing solely on the DC comics character Batman (and his world). It was directed and co-written (with 4 other screenwriters) by Chris McKay (a regular director of the animated TV series'ROBOT CHICKEN'), and Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (the directors and co-writers of 'THE LEGO MOVIE') served as producers on this film. The movie stars the voice talents of Will Arnett (reprising his role as Batman, from 'THE LEGO MOVIE'), Michael Cera (Arnett's costar from the popular TV series 'ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT'), Zach Galifianakis, Rosario Dawson, Ralph Fiennes, Jenny Slate, Hector Elizondo, Doug Benson, Zoe Kravitz, Conan O'Brien, Jason Mantzoukas, Billy Dee Williams (reprising his role as Harvey Dent, from the 1989 live action 'BATMAN' movie) and many others. It's produced by Warner Animation Group and DC Entertainment, and it's of course based on the 'Batman' DC comic books and the Lego Construction Toys. The film has received nearly unanimous rave reviews from critics, and it's expected to be a huge hit at the Box Office. I loved it as well. \n\nBatman (Arnett) is becoming more and more of a loner; and he fears getting close to anyone, because he doesn't want to lose them (like he did his parents). He accidentally adopts an orphan, named Robin (Cera), and Alfred (Fiennes) encourages him to bond with the boy. At the same time The Joker (Galifianakis) is plotting something, and the new Commissioner, Barbara Gordon (Dawson), wants to work with Batman to stop him. Batman of course rejects her help.\n\nThe film is once again hilarious, like the original Lego movie, and it also, once again, has some great psychology; possibly the best of any 'BATMAN' movie. The characters are all really well developed, as well, and they're perfectly cast too (especially Arnett, once again). At first the drama feels forced, but it's also always comedic, and by the end of the film, it's also quite touching. The movie pretty much has it all, just like the first one, and it works on every level. It's also a really well made kids' film, that also appeals to adults (equally as well). The movie is definitely a 5 star film (just like the first one is).\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/xGBv2IpDjDc",

        "reviewText": "'The LEGO Batman Movie (2017)' is the first spin-off film from the surprisingly excellent 'The Lego Movie (2014)'. It's an animated adventure that focuses on the caped crusader's struggle with both family and some of the greatest villains he's ever faced. I was tentative about the feature, since the first LEGO-based film seemed to be 'lightening in a bottle' and would be hard to match in terms of quality. Thankfully, the flick didn't disappoint and, while I don't think it's quite as good as its aforementioned predecessor, I think that it's one of the best animated films - and best Batman films, for that matter - of recent years.\n\nFrom the very beginning of the film, the witty satire and fast-paced jokes are instantly prevalent - in fact, before a single brick appears on screen, several genuinely funny jokes have been made. The opening sequence is a treat, especially to Batman fans. It immediately pulls you into the tone and style of the piece, effortlessly mixing clever set-up with plenty of visual flair. It made me smile immediately. The flick's break-neck pace keeps up for quite a while, which ensures no time for boredom. For me, the movie is at its funniest when satirising Batman's past appearances and his overall lore; the subtle parody and in-jokes never failed to make me grin. The film as a whole is constantly chuckle-worthy; it's genuinely hilarious, at times, too. It works as an almost parody, with an enormous sense of fun constantly present. I'd say it is the most enjoyable film experience I've had this year. The humour is generally pretty inclusive, so even if you aren't well versed in the lore of the caped crusader you'll find something to laugh at: be it sight gags, wordplay, potty humour or sly self-references. It manages to maintain a joyous tone and is a blast to watch because of it.\n\nThankfully, the film knows when to pull it back a little and focus on character. This leads to several scenes that are actually quite poignant and able to affect you emotionally. The characters are all excellently written, as is the script in general. The writers manage to take pre-established characters and seamlessly integrate them into their own zany, plastic universe. Batman himself is arrogant, stubborn, ignorant and insensitive but still remains likable thanks to some believable motivation. He is different to all the other versions we've seen on screen, the zeitgeist of our cultural reverence for the character personified. He's self-aggrandising because we as fans have elevated him up to incredibly high standards. It's a refreshing and somewhat meta take on the character that works really well. He is also given a meaty character arc that, while a little predictable, successfully develops over the course of the film and culminates in a satisfying emotional conclusion. The other characters are all painted vividly too. Alfred appears as a parent figure for a teen-angst ridden Batman, and also gets more action than he has in his prior incarnations. Robin appears as upbeat and chipper as his 1960s counterpart, but he too is developed well and his almost camp nature provides more than a few laughs. The Joker is here, too, and is much better than Jared Leto's attempt at the character (in 'Suicide Squad (2016)'); he feels almost like Cesear Romaro's version, more mischievous than deadly. He has a unique relationship to Batman which provides another strong arc and also appropriately motivates him. The rogues' gallery of Gotham's super-villains is here in full force with almost every Batman villain appearing at some point. Most of them are just broad spoofs of various incarnations of each character, with several of them poking fun at their individual character's very silly nature (Condiment King, anyone?). Their brief but funny cameos are certainly appreciated, even if they generally have little screen time or impact on the plot.\n\nThe animation here is excellent. The use of vibrant colours, a stop-motion aesthetic and fluid character animation really helps boost the visual engagement of the film. So much happens on screen at once that it can be, at times, difficult to discern everything that's going on. That said, you can always see the main action and these sequences are engaging throughout. The zany fighting style that has the characters bouncing around the frame really works with the established universe and tone. The voice acting is all great, too, especially that of Will Arnett and Zach Galifianakis. Their turns, as Batman and The Joker respectively, are some of the best incarnations of the characters and their delivery - while sometimes over the top - includes some subtlety that makes their arcs believable. There are also some cameos from famous people as the various villains, which is fun.\n\nOverall, 'The LEGO Batman Movie (2016)' is a wonderfully fun and vividly animated feature that rivals most of the other live-action incarnations of the dark knight. I had a blast from start to finish and a smile on my face throughout. The characters are well written and the flick has some genuine emotional impact, too. Besides which, it's really funny. The satire is on point and genuinely rather clever; if you're a Batman fan like I am, you'll have an extra layer of enjoyment. This is perhaps the best big-screen version of Batman we're going to get for quite some time. It's incredibly enjoyable. 9/10.",

But it also has adult jokes, that the grown would get, but it would probably go over the kids heads. This is what is missed in a parody film, that goes for gags instead of unfunny shock value that isn't always funny.\n\nWill Arnett does a pretty good Christian Bale impression, to the point I thought it was him. Everybody else embodies there roles perfectly with there voices. The animation really becomes a character itself. Takes jabs at every Batman ever done, and it's effective. I hope there will be more superhero parodies done by Lego.",

        "reviewText": "The Lego movie was one of my favourite movies of 2014. It created this beautiful world around the beloved kids toy, provided some really funny characters (including Batman) and it had a sense of comedy that bordered on self awareness. It worked so well that it left me in tears from laughing so hard. It seemed like lightening in the bottle and when I heard they were making a LEGO Batman movie, I felt like the studio was just trying to cash in on the success of that movie. I was able to catch this with a friend and while I still think the original was the better of the two movies, the LEGO Batman movie still does a great job providing some kid-friendly entertainment and it actually functions as a better Batman movie than what we've gotten over the past couple of years.\n\n*Minor Spoilers Ahead* The movie begins with Batman (Will Arnett) narrating the opening credits, including the Warner Bros. and Ratpak logos (we also get a quote from Michael Jackson that Batman claims he wrote). Then a plane flies into Gotham City airspace. Nothing seems out of the ordinary until a team boards the plane in midair. They break into the plane and their leader reveals himself as the Joker (Zach Galifianakis). The pilot doesn't take him very seriously until Joker explains his plan to destroy Gotham City by releasing most of Gotham's super villains (e.g. Two-Face, Penguin, Bane etc.) to distract Batman while he plants a bomb. Commissioner Jim Gordon warns the mayor of Gotham not to go into the building and negotiate with the Joker but without the ability to signal Batman, she insists on doing it. After she gets in, she attempts to negotiate until she rips off her disguise and reveals herself to be Batman. Batman begins to battle the villains in an attempt to save the city and defeat his \"greatest enemy\" (who he barely acknowledges).\n\nI don't know whether to be happy or sad that this is the best Batman movie we've had since Nolan was running the Batman franchise. I'm mostly serious about that too, this movie has enough understanding of the characters that is way beyond what you would expect. They poke fun at just about everything associated with Batman and they hit the more basic stuff for the kids (Batman's love of rapping and his silly costumes) to the subject matter only adults could appreciate (there's a lot of throwbacks to the Adam West era Batman). I was constantly smiling not only because the movie would fly from funny joke to funny joke but because there were so many Easter eggs related to so many different things. They did some top notch work with the dialogue, I think the original Lego movie was even funnier but they continue with that sense of non-stop comedy. Great animated movies are able to appeal across the age spectrum and as long as you're relatively open-minded to this kind of humour, you'll be laughing throughout The LEGO Batman Movie.\n\nI talked in the opening paragraph about how beautiful the first Lego movie was, this movie is every bit as impressive when it comes to the visuals. They improve upon the animation in the action bits and the character design was excellent. I loved how the characters looked and how they would interact with each other in their own unique ways was cool. I don't want to spoil the other cameos in the movie but what they decided to include from other franchises not only looked interesting but it showed a lot of creativity. Warner Bros. really seemed to throw the book at this movie with all the different franchises that get mixed in and just like the original Lego movie, if you blink you'll miss some subtle visual gag that would make you laugh.\n\nThe voice cast of this movie is huge so I'll only be able to cover the bigger parts. Will Arnett was an excellent pick as Batman. He's got the perfect voice to mock Bruce Wayne's growling as Batman. Michael Cera was perfectly cast as Robin, he ended up stealing a lot of the scenes and Robin's interactions with Batman were not only funny but strangely emotional. Ralph Fiennes was a good pick as Alfred, this is lighter stuff than you usually see him in but he's game for it. Rosario Dawson was also great as Barbara Gordon. Barbara is given more development than you would expect as Jim is largely portrayed as a numbskull. Zach Galifianakis turned out to be an excellent Joker. He's in the movie a lot more than I expected him to be but he nailed it.\n\nI have almost no complaints about this movie. I really think they did a good job of expanding on the LEGO movie and they showed that this isn't just some throwaway project for the studio. This movie really isn't afraid to skewer Batman with some crazy funny jokes and yet it still touches on the stuff you need to see in a kids movie (the message of family isn't new but they work it in and they sell it by the end). I'm giving this movie an 8.5/10 but I'll round up to a 9/10.",

        "reviewText": "Yeah, I was a tad disappointed that this had little to do with \"The Lego Movie\" other than Batman appearing as a character. Well, there were cameos by other DC superheroes that were also in the movie. I was kind of hoping that they would use the same twist ending in this film as they did the original, but it's still a great movie. The best bits are actually probably at the very beginning where it seems like Batman is literally riffing on the movie in the very beginning, making fun of the logos. That's very clever and it shows that this movie wants to be funny from the get go.\n\nThere are just so many hilarious lines in this and many scenes that I just couldn't stop laughing at. Unlike the laughtrack of a TV show, it's great to watch this in a theater as the laughter is authentic. It also helps that the animation in this is downright gorgeous. I guess it's not quite on par as the original Lego movie, but it's still beautiful. This is the kind of movie where there's never a dull moment. It's not just something like a Michael Bay film where it's stupid action over and over. Instead, we get observations on what's going on in a satirical way.\n\nThe voices worked so well in this. I could have sworn that was Patton Oswalt voicing the Joker. I guess I'm just so used to hearing his voice in every cartoon I see. The pacing of the film is great. The final battle sequences are timed so well and we get a lot of action scenes that have great purpose. I didn't understand why there weren't any \"Star Wars\" characters in this, seeing as how the other Lego movie had them. I'd think you'd want to include elements from such a popular series, especially if you have the rights to them. For something with great joke after great joke, check this out! ***1/2",

I too love the character and I'm always looking forward to the next big thing with the caped crusader. So how strange is it that the latest movie with Batman happens to be a comedy?\n\nSpeaking of comedies, one of the best in the past few years was The Lego Movie. It was fast, quip, very unique with it's humor, and topped it off with some stellar animation. What was though to be a giant product placement (and probably is) turned into what had to be one of the most libertarian stories of all time. The Lego Movie is something that I've seen several times and I continue to find new things. To expand this universe, their version of Batman now gets his own movie in The Lego Batman Movie. \n\nIn what has to be a giant tribute to everything fun about Batman, almost every villain he's faced is working with the Joker (played by Zach Galifianakis) to detonate another bomb to destroy Gotham. Of course, Batman (played by Will Arnett) takes everyone down, stops the explosion, and then tells the Joker that he's not his greatest enemy. Hurt knowing that he's not the greatest villain, Joker develops a new plan to show that he is important. Meanwhile at Jim Gordon's retirement party, his daughter Barbara (played by Rosario Dawson) announces that the police would like to work with Batman to finally end the caped crusader's vigilantism. To top things off, the Joker arrives with every other super villain to surrender.\n\nThis puts Batman in a state of boredom until he decides that Joker must be banished to the Phantom Zone (the place where Superman sends General Zod in the second Superman movie). With help from his accidental adopted son Dick Grayson (played by Michael Cera) who is taking up the mantle of Robin and his butler Alfred (played by Ralph Fiennes), Batman succeeds in his mission, only to find the Joker has a major comeback planned.\n\nI cannot spoil what Joker does, but it follows on the continuity of how The Lego Movie is built, but it's crazy and over-the-top. Over the top are the three words to best describe The Lego Batman Movie. I mean that in a good way, as the film works as a major satire and tribute to everything that is Batman. What's stranger is that this is a way better Batman movie then last years Batman V Superman. The people making this clearly understand that character better and even give Batman a better character arc. \n\nWill Arnett has to be the perfect choice for this kind of Batman; tough and intimidating, but also full of himself and very selfish. You still sympathize with him as he learns about his various figures of \"family\" and tries to movie forward in his dealings as the crusader. While I can say the everyone else was great, I was surprised by how quick Michael Cera was as a funny Robin.\n\nThe Lego Batman Movie is another \"joke a minute\" story that's similar to The Lego Movie. If you didn't like that movie, this'll probably not sway you over. What's hard about this movie is that The Lego Movie just seemed like a perfect script. This isn't perfect, even though I laughed a lot. It's just that the original movie set it's standards so high that the expectations are now at an intimidating level. \n\nI'll give this nine Lego Batmans out of ten. This should provide a good example on how a parody should be done in Hollywood. It's been a while since we've gotten a good parody like this. Kids and their parents should have a fun time with this Batman¬Ömaybe even more then the live action one. Take your capes, masks, batarangs, and batman shark repellent to the movies and laugh as this caped crusader makes your happy.",

        "reviewText": "After a long hiatus of not reviewing movies, I am back, and it feels great. I will start things back up first with The Lego Batman movie, then tomorrow with John Wick: Chapter 2. So without further delaying, here is my review of The Lego Batman Movie.\n\n2014 bought us one of the best animated films to date, The Lego Movie, and riding the success of that film comes this movie. To be honest The Lego Movie is one of my favorite films period in this decade. In comparison The Lego Batman movie is a well written movie in terms of comedy and action, but the story is not as well developed as the previous Lego movie. The other film was able to interject many adult points into the plot without overcomplicating things. The Lego Batman film is without a doubt a fantastic movie to watch with the entire family. It has nonstop laughs, pokes fun at comic book movies in general, and is never boring. This is surely a must watch movie.\n\nChris McKay is the director of this movie. McKay is known for having directed many episodes of the adult animated show, Robot Chicken. For a director on a show like that to make the big transition in terms of the extreme level of comedy from Robot Chicken to this film is very impressive. Some of the jokes do get close to raunchy, but never actually cross that line. There are a few actions scenes that are really impressive to watch, especially if you get to see this movie in IMAX. McKay as the director really delivers in this aspect. This is truly one of the best elements of the film, and director Chris McKay deserves credit here.\n\nProbably my favorite part of the movie besides the fun actions scenes and the jokes was the amazing score from composer Lorne Balfe. Balfe is known for working on movies such as Iron Man, The Dark Knight, and Inception. While you can easily say the score here is more of another joke towards the comic book genre in general, it certainly fits this movie. As someone who really enjoys scores, I will be listening to this again and again.\n\nIn closing, this is truly the first great movie of the year, while the plot is thin compared to the previous Lego movie, it is well worth the price of admission. The extra money for IMAX is also worth it in my opinion, especially if you have the option of IMAX 3D. Animated movies seem to be the best bang for your buck for the 3D movies. This film is also great fun for the entire family, so taking your kids to this movie is certainly a must.\n\n8/10",

        "reviewText": "This film tells the story of Batman who is challenged by the Joker to save Gotham City from massive destruction. In addition, he has to take responsibility for an orphan that he adopted by mistake. \n\n\"The LEGO Batman Movie\" exceeds my expectations! It is really a lot of fun, as it keeps making fun of Batman, and to a lesser extent, Superman. The music is uplifting and contemporary, connecting it to adult audiences. The vibrant colours and elaborate Lego set designs are very pleasing to the eyes too. I really like the fact that the final showdown looks like one giant party, which makes the film a very happy film. Furthermore, the appearances of unexpected villains such as Gremlins and even a character from another hugely successful wizarding book enhance the fun factor. I loved it.",

        "reviewText": "I saw \"The LEGO Batman Movie\", starring the voices of Will Arnett- Arrested Development_tv, Jonah Hex; Michael Cera-Children's Hospital_tv, Arrested Development_tv; Rosario Dawson-Daredevil_tv, Unstoppable; Ralph Fiennes-Spectre, the Harry Potter movies and Zach Galifianakis- Baskets_tv, Up in the Air.\n\nThis is a spin-off of the 2014 'The LEGO Movie'. Will once again voices Batman as a dark and relentless vigilante that works alone, and is darn good at it. The movie opens with Will giving his best Mystery Science Theater 3000 reading of what is happening on screen. One of the best things I liked about the movie is that there is plenty of humor along with the battles. There is also a lesson to be learned about needing help in your never ending battles against the forces of evil-it takes a village or in this case, a family. Michael voices Dick Grayson, who becomes Robin. Rosario voices Barbara Gordon, the newly appointed police commissioner-Jim Gordon retired-who also becomes Batgirl. Ralph is Alfred, the butler that basically raised Batman from a boy and Zach is the villainous Joker, who just wants Batman to acknowledge him as his number one arch nemesis. Lots of villains and heroes show up and it is fun trying to recognize the voices-I remember hearing Billy Dee Williams, Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill, Conan O'Brien and even Mariah Carey. I checked in the end credits and there were more that I missed. There are inside jokes for adults and a flashback of some of the other actors who portrayed Batman; they used the actual film instead of the LEGO format and I loved seeing the 1966 Adam West doing the Bat-usi again! Overall, it's a great Batman movie. It's rated \"PG\" for rude humor and action and has a running time of 1 hour & 44 minutes. I really liked it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",

      "text": "Over Gotham City airspace, two best friend pilots are transporting an insane amount of explosives. They are hijacked by The Joker (voice of Zach Galifianakis) and his minions. Across the city, Joker has set loose some of Gotham's most notorious criminals, including Harley Quinn (voice of Jenny Slate), Two-Face (voice of Billy Dee Williams), The Riddler (voice of Conan O'Brien), Scarecrow (voice of Jason Mantzoukas), Catwoman (voice of Zoe Kravitz), Poison Ivy (voice of Riki Lindhome), Clayface (voice of Kate Miccuci), Bane (voice of Doug Benson), Mr. Freeze, The Penguin, and some C-list villains like Calendar Man, Gentleman Ghost, and Condiment King. The pilot knows Batman (voice Will Arnett) will stop Joker, but he believes otherwise.\n\nBeneath the city's central core, Joker has Killer Croc plant a bomb that would level Gotham and plunge it into an abyss. Commissioner Jim Gordon (voice of Hector Elizondo) tries to use the Bat-signal to contact Batman, but Eggman has egged it down. Jim and Chief O'Hara go downtown to spring into action while the villains continue to run amok. Jim meets with Mayor McCaskill (voice of Mariah Carey) before she is airlifted to the central core. Joker and his villains are all gathered to watch the city be destroyed, but the Mayor reveals herself to be Batman in disguise. He proceeds to single-handedly beat down every villain before trying to catch The Joker. Batman latches onto Joker with his grappling hook but Joker reminds him that the bomb is still active. When Joker calls himself Batman's worst enemy, Batman rebuffs it by stating that Joker means nothing to him, and that nobody does. Joker looks heartbroken as Batman rushes to stop the bomb. He succeeds, and the city cheers Batman on.\n\nBatman returns to his home on his own island. He spends his free time alone in the Batcave, eating leftover lobster thermidor and cackling maniacally during \"Jerry Maguire\". Batman later stares at a portrait of himself as a child with his parents on the night they died. He starts addressing the portrait and says his parents would have been proud that he saved the city again. He is then startled by Alfred (voice of Ralph Fiennes), so Batman accidentally dropkicks him into the piano. After apologizing, Alfred realizes that Batman is going through another one of his phases and is just sad at the prospect of having another family. Alfred then reminds Batman that there is a gala later that day for Jim Gordon's retirement, which Batman reluctantly goes to.\n\nOn the way to the gala, Batman (now out of disguise as Bruce Wayne) watches a news report on how Superman (voice of Channing Tatum) sent General Zod into the Phantom Zone. Joker is watching the same report in his lair with Harley and sees certain famous villains beyond the realm of Gotham City are contained there. Thus, Joker hatches his latest idea.\n\nAt the gala, Bruce is approached by an orphan, Dick Grayson (voice of Michael Cera). He's a sweet kid who longs for another family. Dick asks Bruce if he would consider adopting him, just as Bruce's attention is caught by the new commissioner, Jim's daughter Barbara (Rosario Dawson). She gets up to talk to the citizens of Gotham about her latest idea: she wants the police force to team up with Batman because on his own, he hasn't done much to take care of the huge crime problem in the city. Bruce does not like the idea one bit, and moments later, the gala is interrupted by Joker and his villain team. Bruce goes into Batman mode and Master-Builds himself a vehicle while Barbara attempts to confront Joker on her own terms. To everyone's surprise, Joker surrenders himself and all the villains (except Harley) to the police. With Gotham's worst all locked up, Barbara receives credit while Batman is left to go home in disbelief.\n\nBatman stalks Arkham Asylum for any suspicious activity. He sees a van driven by Harley (now out of disguise as Harleen Quinzel) with the logo \"Phantom's Own Laundry Service\". He knows something suspicious is going on, but Barbara sees him and tells him to let the police worry about it.\n\nBack at Wayne Manor, Batman tries to access Joker's plans through the computer, but Alfred put a parental lock on the computer. He tells Batman that he should spend time with Dick, whom he had adopted over a week ago. Batman is baffled and refuses to do anything with the boy until Alfred purposely leads Dick into the Batcave. Dick is amazed to know that Batman is one of his new dads. Meanwhile, Batman schemes to put Joker in the Phantom Zone, but he must steal the Phantom Zone Projector, which is located in Superman's Fortress of Solitude. When the computer determines that Batman is way too \"jacked\" to fit into the vents that would take him to the Projector's location, he gets the idea to have Dick join him so that he can fetch it. Dick goes through Batman's costumes for a cool outfit to wear, and he settles on Batman's \"Reggae Man\" outfit and names himself Robin.\n\nThe Dynamic Duo arrive at the Fortress of Solitude. While Robin goes to find the Projector, Batman creates a diversion by knocking on Superman's door. To Batman's surprise, Superman and the rest of the Justice League - including Green Lantern (voice of Jonah Hill), Flash (voice of Adam Devine), Wonder Woman, Cyborg, Aquaman, Martian Manhunter, and the Wonder Twins - are celebrating an anniversary party without having invited Batman. A dejected Batman leaves when nobody is looking just as Robin has gotten through the complicated security system to retrieve the Projector. Batman almost admits that he's proud of Robin, but he's also too proud to admit it.\n\nBatman and Robin head on down to Arkham to take on Joker. Barbara finds them and has them go through security. When Robin is caught trying to smuggle the Projector, the two beat up the guards and run to Joker's cell. Just as he expected, Batman confronts Joker and hits him with the Projector, sending him into the Phantom Zone.\n\nIn the Phantom Zone, Joker is met by a sentient brick called Phyllis (voice of Ellie Kemper). After scanning Joker for badness, she has him meet some of the most notorious villains of all time, like Lord Voldemort (voice of Eddie Izzard), Sauron (voice of Jemaine Clement), King Kong (voice of Seth Green), The Kraken, Jaws, Agent Smith, Dracula, Medusa, The Wicked Witch of the West, the Gremlins, and the Daleks. He tells the villains that he has a plan to get them all out of there. Back in Arkham, Harley steals the Projector and uses it to bring back every last villain. Joker unleashes them all on the city to cause mass mayhem. Sauron floods the streets with lava, Voldemort turns people into animals, and King Kong smashes through the city.\n\nBatman (who got himself and Robin locked up) asks Barbara to let him go so that he can go save the city. She agrees only on the condition that he allow her to join and help. Batman begrudgingly agrees, and he is now joined by Barbara, Robin, and Alfred (who somehow made it from Wayne Manor to Arkham on his own). The heroes take the Batwing across the city as they try to locate Joker. Sauron has his eye locked on Batman and has led Joker to Wayne Manor, where Joker finds Batman's stash of romantic comedies.\n\nThe Gremlins start tearing into the Batwing, leading Batman to hop outside and leave the Batwing on autopilot with some rope tied to the controls. Robin and Alfred join him in taking out the Gremlins. Robin falls off the Batwing, and Batman jumps to rescue him. Alfred falls off too and nearly plummets to his death, but Barbara takes control of the Batwing and saves him. Batman then comes up with a plan and has Barbara fly toward Sauron's eye, just as Kraken blasts a fireball at the Batwing. At the right moment, Barbara steers the Batwing away and causes Sauron to get blown to bits, meaning Joker no longer has an eye on Batman.\n\nThe heroes make it to Wayne Island and applaud each other for their accomplishments. Robin takes a selfie with everyone as his new family, which then strikes a nerve with Batman. The other three go into the Batwing for more gear, but Batman locks them in there and has the computer send them to the border of Gotham City and Bludhaven so that he can protect them and fight Joker on his own.\n\nBatman finds Joker inside his home, but Batman is surrounded by all the villains, completely outnumbered. Joker only wants to hear Batman say that he hates him and considers him his worst enemy, but Batman is stubborn and refuses to acknowledge it. Joker takes the Projector and sends Batman to the Phantom Zone.\n\nBatman meets Phyllis, who scans him and determines that while he's not bad enough to be considered a villain, he has done a lot of bad things to people that care about him. Batman realizes he has been trying to protect himself from getting hurt again. He makes a deal with Phyllis to bring back all the villains if she lets him go back to Gotham.\n\nBatman's computer overrides his commands to protect him and sends Robin, Barbara, and Alfred back to the island to fight the villains. Batman is sent back as well, and he apologizes to his friends for deceiving them. He opts to get help not only from them, but from all of his enemies broken out of Arkham. He even gives Barbara her own suit, dubbing her \"Batgirl\".\n\nThe team faces off against Joker's villains, with all of them being gradually sent back to the Phantom Zone. However, the bomb from earlier goes off and starts to break the city apart. Batman and his friends all form a chain link using their heads and feet to pull the city back together, along with the citizens of Gotham. It's still not enough, so Batman is forced to ask for Joker's help. Batman admits to Joker that he truly is his greatest enemy and that they need each other. Joker is touched and helps Batman pull the city back together.\n\nWith the city saved, Batman must fulfill his end of the bargain and return to the Phantom Zone. He reveals himself as Bruce Wayne to Robin and finally accepts him as a son. They have a tearful hug goodbye as Batman ascends to the Phantom Zone. However, he gets blocked from going up. Phyllis appears and tells Batman that she has seen how he changed to help those that he cares about, and has decided he can stay with his friends. Batman and Joker then part ways as Joker heads off with the rest of the rogues. Batman decides to give them a 30-minute head start before he and his team go catch them.\n\nBatman and Robin are both now part of a new family. Batman hangs up the family selfie in his room. As the credits begin, Robin asks Batman if he can play a song that he's written specifically for the credits. Batman and all his friends and enemies get together to perform the song."

It's able to recontextualize the central conflict of the title with added depth and fixes a lot of the plot holes.\n\nIt also comes to a more satisfying conclusion due to great callbacks to previously unseen characters and is allowed to be more mature by being able to show more of the violence rather than hide from it or edit it out. Additionally, seeing more of Henry Cavill's Superman saving people is always welcome.\n\nNot all of the problems are fixed as the unnecessarily destructive third act is obviously still present as is the forced franchise set-up that still feels very clunky. Ben Affleck's portrayal of Batman is still excellent but the increased violence makes him killing even more distracting.",

The gaps in the story are filled, and the characters have more depth.\n\nIn PG-13 films the action is lukewarm, bloodless, and that degrades the impression of the whole film. The film received intensity, atmosphere and worthy action in its R-rated version. A lot of films failed due to the short-sightedness of producers and film studios.\n\nThe cast, with the exception of Jesse Eisenberg, is excellent. Yes, I didn't like Lex Luthor, but Henry Cavill as Superman and Ben Affleck as Batman are great. Henry Cavill seems to have stepped down from the pages of comics and is certainly a great choice for this role.\n\nIn this version his character is more complete and gains in depth. Ben Affleck excellently portrayed this iconic figure. His Batman is dark, furious and brutal. The only miss is Lex Luthor, but maybe his character would improve in the sequels that would follow.\n\nApart from the improved story, the action is better, more brutal and there are no restrictions set by the PG-13 standard.\n\nThe casting is really great, although Lex Luthor is a complete failure, but like I said, maybe his character would have evolved further had we been able to see how the story unfolded later. The cinematography is excellent, and the costume design itself did a great job.\n\nThis version of the film would definitely have been better accepted, if only the film studio had a little more courage. The action scenes are superbly directed.\n\nBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice Ultimate Edition is certainly a big improvement over the theatrical version.",

        "reviewText": "I'm so glad we are finally distinguishing this work of art from the much weaker theatrical version.\n\nThe trailers robbed this movie of its greatness. Whoever approved those trailers should be exiled from working in the film industry ever again. They literally showed the whole movie in them, and whoever watched the trailers ruined the experience for himself then and there. So, if you haven't seen the movie already, please don't watch the trailers.\n\nDesign of the main villain could've been better. Some elements and characters do feel rushed into the story. People like to talk crap about ''that'' scene, and i agree that it could've been executed a bit better, but the movie set it all up excellently from the start, and it makes absolutely perfect sense, because if anything else was said it wouldn't work.\n\nBen Affleck is still my perfect Bruce Wayne/Batman, even after watching Robert Pattinson in the suit. Henry Cavill as Superman - amazing. Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman - good. Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL delivered amazing score, and the opening sequence and ''Beautiful Lie'' is one of my favorite opening sequences in any movie, ever. (Zack Snyder also did flipped camera/bat walk there before Matt Reeves lol).\n\nThe themes and character motivations are all there and they all stick perfectly. Man of Steel story continues into this movie and it is presented in totally realistic and grounded way with the human conflict behind it all, despite the fact that we are talking about superheroes. The visuals, as in any Zack Snyder movie, are absolutely beautiful.\n\nIt has great fight sequences, it has Ben Affleck working out Rocky style so he can carry a giant tank as an armor, it has some of the coldest, most menacing and memorable lines delivered in the superhero movie, it has sassiest and classiest Alfred. What more could you want.\n\nThis draws major inspiration from Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns, from the story, to the visuals, to the very portrayal of Batman itself, which is one of my favorite versions of Batman. This is angry Batman who suffered a lot trough the years and it makes perfect sense that he doesn't care if lowest of lows criminal scum lives or dies. It makes perfect sense and i don't care if ''Batman in the comics has no kill rule'', and ''Batman doesn't use guns''. Boo hoo. Who cares. It also makes perfect sense for this 2 characters here, with different looks onto the world and different looks from the world onto them, to clash.\n\nSure, the movie has its flaws, and some things could've been executed better, but overall this movie is hated for all the wrong reasons, and it deserves more love and understanding, instead of circlejerking about one same thing over and over again from the ignorant people who refuse to open their minds. I adore BvS Ultimate Edition and you can too.",

It made me think, feel, and had my favorite Batman and Superman in it (with an awesome Wonder Woman too).\n\nWhen this Ultimate Edition came out though, I had to buy it and watch it right away. I was blown away. It was actually better than the theatrical cut! And seeing it several times over the years, this film has become even better than the day it released. In my opinion it is one of the most interesting, thoughtful, emotional, and beautiful superhero movies ever created. I can honestly say it changed my life, and I will always defend it.",

        "reviewText": "After watching it for the third time, second with the Ultimate Cut I can say I love the story, tone and almost everything about the movie except for the writing for Lex and some minor things but the overall feeling of the movie makes up for it. Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL created a soundtrack that fits the movie perfectly. The characters from Man of Steel is improved and is overall better and the addition of Ben Affleck's Batman, Jeremy Irons' Alfred and other characters creates a great ensemble cast and the actors bring great and memorable performances. My take on the story is that it is really realistic, Superman would be seen as a god in a way and I agree fully with Batman's thoughts, look at the Injustice games/comics, simply great writing.\n\nThe fighting sequences are well choreographed and the warehouse scene, one of my all time favorite live action Batman scenes! There are more powerful action sequences, but the movie is about the politics and drama and not as action heavy as Man of Steel.\n\nHenry Cavill is great in this film but Ben Affleck really steals the spotlight, but the character development that Clark Kent receives is worth it as he's one step closer from becoming the superhero we love and know so well.\n\nBen Affleck's Bruce Wayne and Batman is brilliantly played and written, the character has been criticized for killing as Batman never kills. I understand and I got a problem with it to but I know why he kills in this movie, he's angry but everything comes down to all the loss and depression he suffers. He doesn't have anything good left in the world, Dick Grayson got murdered by The Joker. His only family and probably only friend is Alfred, and when Zod's attack on Metropolis happened, Bruce Wayne saw it up close and witnessed allt he death that these God like beings could do and realistically, he wants to do something to prevent from more harm and its a human thing to do, to hate. Zack Snyder's Bruce Wayne is more flawed than any other portrayals of the character but it might also be the most realistic portrayal of Batman.\n\nLex Luthor's big plan isn't really what you expect from a villain in a comic book movie. It's political and well thought out, something that can highly likely happen in the real world. It's another element that makes the film so great in my eyes, how the writers and Zack Snyder wanted to make the movie realistic and portray Superman in a way that would happen in real life. Jesse Eisenburg plays Lex in a fresh and unique way, not really comic book accurate but I strongly believe that after the character development from this movie he will then become the Lex Luthor we know and love. But I have to admit it, I like Zack Snyder's version of the character and Jesse Eisenburg did a terrific performance as the iconic villain.\n\nMany people doesn't appreciate the dream sequence that's called the Knightmare, I understand why as it drags down the pacing. But why did Zack Snyder choose to place it into the movie? It all comes down to his 5 film plan that he never got to finish, the dream sequence shows us what would possibly happen if Darkseid wins in the future and that means Superman will turn bad. In my opinion it's smart writing.\n\nI understand that this movie isn't for everyone and that's alright, but I love it. The visual storytelling, gritty and realistic tone, original and simply fascinating to look at as the imagery is perfection. Zack Snyder nailed it with the Ultimate Cut and have created an epic superhero film about two of my favorite heroes.\n\n(Edited this after my 4th watch)",

        "reviewText": "I consider Sucker Punch to be Snyder's only middling film, view the director¬¥s cut of Watchmen as one of the best adaptations of all time and adore the source material, so this film is tailor made for me. Especially due to my love for the utterly daring Man of Steel. I understand where some (but not all!) of the mixed reviews are coming from but share few of their opinions.\n\nFirst with the bad: The juicy Justice League teaser needed to be placed differently. I also expected a longer final battle and a stronger acknowledgement of how much carnage the 2 cities undergo at the end. There is also 1 scene of Superman in peril too many towards the end. None of these complains took away from my enjoyment and i was BLOWN AWAY by everything else. The film features top of the line directing and the best score Hans Zimmer/Junkie XL ever composed. The well-constructed script by Chris Terrio explained the clashing ideologies very well and is downright Nolan-esque, due to the continued involvement of David Goyer who is the secondary writer of the final film. Every single performance is some of the finest acting the A-level cast put on film. Especially Jesse Eisenberg! His psychotic and utterly unhinged Lex Luthor outshines even Heath Ledger. Gal Gadot is another standout and shows how well cast and though out the whole DCU truly is.\n\nNow to the titular heroes: Ben Affleck matches Christian Bale and Kevin Konroy as being a definitive take on the character but don't expect him to be \"likable\". His version is a Frank Miller Batman gone too far and the film is a clear redemption arc for the bitter warrior. Some will be turned off by his high body count and his deeply flawed tunnel vision but that is the whole point of the film and especially the ending. Batman is the tragic villain of the film. Henry Cavill's Superman is again on point and presents a tragic take on John Byrne's and more importantly Dan Jurgens' iconic version. I now repeatedly mentioned the source material but this film is an adaptation first and foremost, unlike the MCU competition. I am also a fan of their highly different films and they constantly veer off the source. Not here. Basically every scene has a counterpart in a comic or even videogame. The mentioned creators (and many more) are proudly listed in the credits and produced some of the most iconic and bestselling comics of all time. I highly suggest looking them up after digesting this monumental epos and the film adapted way more of The Dark Knight Returns than i ever expected. This brings me to the film's one glaring and fascinating \"problem\". The films should be near incomprehensible to non-comic readers and may be the first 200+ million film that goes out its way to target an adult and comic literate audience! Young children, family audiences and casual fans are destined to be baffled by this film and i am not even sure if i can call it a \"mainstream\" movie. The pacing is more comparable to a cerebral thriller and the whole product is a blatant deconstruction of messianic ideals, which will offend many on principle alone. A true Twilight of the Superheroes. The best cinematic comparison i can make is the equally busy Excalibur 1981. I further believe that all of Zack Snyder's superhero adaptations got unfair scrutiny because they dared to go beyond preconceived notions of what a big budget comic adaptation should be and hope that future generations will reassess them and join me in the sun.\n\nI can only conclude that i view the film as a complete and utter creative successes. I also hope that this daring film will lead to more creativity and equal risks down the line, from all competitors on the market. The DCU weight on the right shoulders and its future is now in the hands of the fans, as never before. The film often asks if there must be a Superman. I say yes but we also need Zack Synder.\n\nPS: The shorter and WB mandated theatrical cut is a 8/10 and make sure to watch the \"Remastered\" version of Snyder¬¥s intended vision as it has the correct color grading and the 4:3 aspect ratio during the 4 prolonged Imax sequences.",

It setup the story Goyer same guy who did Dark Knight Series and Terrio who did Argo and it was a great story at that when shown in full..\n\nThe introductions of Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot Jeremy Irons as well was done nicely in my opinion..\n\nI dont understand the slack this film gets I thoroughly enjoyed it the action scenes where amazing but thats to be expected in Snyder films that are all cult classics btw as a silent observer.\n\nThe Martha scene gets sooo much hate when in reality its quite simple in my head so Ima try and break it down as simply I can.. Clark SuperMan Kent for the first time in his life has his one weakness Kryptonite not some spray of Kryptonite a literal Dagger of Kryptonite feet away from him could you imagine for the first time in your life going to the pain and weakness he could be going through? Just a thought.. He struggles to gather say any words make it coherent in what could be his very last moment to save his mother.. Bruce is all is rage seeing blood red about to conquer what he set out to do after going through all he's dealt with from his parents 20 something years of Gotham and Robin's death then hearing his own mothers name would I think make any man hesitate and ask why.. Lois showing up at the very moment to save her hero Clark who builds their relationship.. them boom magic from there where the last 45mins is nothing but KICK ASSERY from the warehouse scene to the epic fight with doomsday...\n\nJust amazing I hope what I thought of Martha scene comes across properly for me anyways and what I thought watching it for the first time and everytime after..\n\nThis film gets soooo much slack when it set such amazing groundwork for continuing universe from ZSJL and beyond that..",

The film's reputation would grow over the following decade. Today many regard it as being superior to Chris Nolan's trilogy.\n\nThe brainchild behind \"Phantasm\" was artist Bruce Timm, the man responsible for the look, style and tone of \"Batman: The Animated Series\". When he entered the DC universe in the late 1980s, Timm began to popularise a very specific drawing/animation style: a distinct form of Art Deco, with angular characters, hard, geometric shapes, retro minimalism and strong nods to 1950s modernism, futurism, and Old Hollywood. There's also a deliberate attempt to recapture the magic of Max Fleischer, the man responsible for the iconic Superman animated series of the 1940s. Your typical Bruce Timm female was also markedly different to previous comic book femmes: either angular noir women (Lauren Bacall, Jane Russell, Veronica Lake et all), or near pre-pubescent sexpots (small busted, lithe, teenage yet suggestively curvy). He'd release a sketchbook collection of simple-yet-hyper-fetishized nude girls/women a decade later, which would quickly become the dirty bible of many comic book artists.\n\nToday a lot of superhero cartoons poorly copy Timm's style ‚Äì the style's now been played to death - but in the 1990s he revitalised DC and helped pull Batman away from the grip and stylistic influence of Frank Miller, who typified Batman of the 1980s.\n\n\"Mask of the Phantasm\" features a weak villain and unnecessary action sequence too derivative of James Cameron (\"Terminator 2\" was released the year before), but it's nevertheless a very moody picture, structured as a series of wistful dreams or tragic recollections, and features a genuinely affecting Gothic love story. Like the best Batman tales, \"Phantasm\" is more about detective work than fisticuffs. This Batman is voiced by the inimitable Kevin Conroy. It contains one of the best lines in Batman history.\n\n8/10 ‚Äì Worth two viewings.",

        "reviewText": "Superhero fans of my generation had tons of great cartoons to watch while we we're growing up, and Batman: The Animated Series was right up there among the best. It combined action with a cool art style and serious plots that made the show just as appealing to adults as it was to kids. Mask of the Phantasm is a side-story of that amazing show, so it's no surprise that I still love it all these years later.\n\nPhantasm works so well because it pairs the usual themes of the show with an extremely bittersweet love story and tons of the detective elements that are always present in Batman's best tales. Equal time is spent with the present day mystery of the Phantasm, and Bruce's early experiments with vigilante justice. \n\nIt's great to see Bruce Wayne get equal focus in the story, and in many ways the scenes with him out of costume are the most interesting and pivotal to the story. The Joker plays a crucial part in the plot, and a woman is introduced who had a powerful influence on Bruce's decision to become Batman. What more could the true Batman fan ask for? Mask of the Phantasm is worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as The Dark Knight and Batman Returns. There's a classic story within its animated trappings.",

A very fun ride, that's packed with twists & sharp action-sequences. \n\n'Batman: Mask of the Phantasm' Synopsis: Batman is wrongly implicated in a series of murders of mob bosses actually done by a new vigilante assassin.\n\n'Batman: Mask of the Phantasm' works from start to end. The main plot is extraordinary, offering an all twist in the caped crusader's legend, while the romantic-track, though slightly lethargic, has moments of emotions. And the Action-Sequences are sharp. In fact, the Animation is just top-class! \n\nAlan Burnett, Paul Dinim, Martin Pasko & Michael Reaves's Screenplay is excellent. Eric Radomski and Bruce Timm's Direction is of high-standard. Vocal-Performances are sure to mesmerize. Kevin Conroy as Batman, gives the legend a voice with sheer restrain. Dana Delany as Andrea Beaumont, is a delight. Hart Bochner as City Councilman Arthur Reeves, is deliciously despicable. Stacy Keach as Carl Beaumont, doesn't lack conviction. Mark Hamill as Joker, however, steals the show. What a frighteningly stunning performance! \n\nOn the whole, 'Batman: Mask of the Phantasm' is a massive winner!",

        "reviewText": "This is easily the best interpretation of Batman I have seen in animated form, and along with Tim Burton's sometimes unfairly maligned 'Batman Returns', the best Batman movie to date. There has been a lot of speculation in recent years about movie versions of Frank Miller's 'The Dark Knight Returns' and/or 'Batman: Year One' (the latter being an obvious inspiration for 'Mask Of The Phantasm'), I just hope that if either eventually get made they are as good as this. The popular 1960s campy TV series was an absolute hoot, but unfortunately has permanently coloured a lot of people's expectations of Batman, a character generally a lot darker and more twisted than most people expect. The animation in this movie is excellent, the script isn't a masterpiece but it's very good, and the actors involved include some great talents like Stacy Keach ('The Ninth Configuration'), 'Star Wars' Mark Hamill (as The Joker), John P. Ryan ('Runaway Train'), and Roger Corman legend Dick Miller ('A Bucket Of Blood'). I think most fans of Batman in any of his comic book incarnations over the years will enjoy this one a lot.

        "reviewText": "Batman: Mask of the Phantasm stands on its own feet extremely well, when at least compared to some of the lessor Batman animated movies (Batman vs Dracula anyone?), and packs a good punch for fans so many years later. The original series was in its own other region- taking what more stories from the comics (if not overall style and atmosphere like Burton or Nolan)- and was able to cover some fine ground with our troubled hero the Dark Knight. This story tells of a character, not ever quite named but called here as 'Phantasm', who is killing off some of the high-rolling gangsters in town. Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne meets an old love of his, Andrea, and old wounds are opened over a brief and untimely ended engagement. And then there's also Andrea's father, who... OK, not much to try and spoil here, lets just say at some point the Joker gets involved, and everything jets into a 'laughing matter'.\n\nEven as it was meant originally for TV, the directors Radomski and Timm, through their writer collaborators, have applied a drawing style that is distinctive amongst other cartoons of its ilk from the period: very direct lines and sharp, jagged edges, lots of smoke at (specific) times, the right blend of noir when it comes to revealing the caped crusader when he enters a room in the dead of night. In a sense they're stylists as are the (good) directors of the franchise live-action films. Only here there's a catch: the running time is short (originally the filmmakers thought it would be meant for TV before WB changed their minds), so there's only so much time to dig into the dilemma Wayne is caught in in the movie, where his identity is being cross-checked all over as the killer of the gangsters, and then the personal connection with Andrea and her father. Its some fairly significant probing into the character, if not the deepest there's ever been.\n\nBut also, aside from the slightly darker impulses, Mask of the Phantasm is a lot of fun, even up to a point if you didn't watch the series much. Just seeing Hammil ham it up as the Joker is a blast, even though he doesn't appear (almost, one might think, as a lark) until halfway through the movie! But he (via the filmmakers trying their best to give fans the best of the animated basics) supplies a hugely entertaining climax, one which involves a big fight among an immense diorama of Gotham City, rigged with explosives!",

        "reviewText": "Bioshock's iconic opening was surely inspired by that of the one in Batman: Mask of the Phantasm. They both use the same Futurist- steeped, sleek Art Deco style which inspire the towering structures of the city, and swoop in, out and between the 3D models to establish their mood and atmosphere. The film is from a time when animation was getting more and more comfortable with these types of three dimensional sequences which turn the traditionally flat canvas into a visual playground; think Quasimodo swinging around the bell towers of Notre Dame like Spiderman, or the iconic chandelier shot in Beauty and the Beast. It's an altogether more classical rendition of Gotham City and its inhabitants, cobbling together various anachronistic elements to resemble something of a neo-noir: steel arches, fedoras, figures ripped straight from Edward Hopper's Nighthawks, shameless womanisers, bikers with chains and bats, and the long halls and longer shadows of Wayne Manor. This is a far cry from the recent realist depictions of Nolan's Batman trilogy, which evoked a frantic, terror-stricken, post-9/11 atmosphere in a setting far larger than what a simple animated figure could cover in one night. Nolan's Gotham has slums within slums and cities within cities, indulging in panoramic widescreen IMAX shots, and reflect a reality where the enemy isn't merely thugs with guns but larger sociopolitical and economical structures. It is worlds away from the moralities that Phantasm initially implies in its art: stark, boldly lined, clearly drawn. \n\nLike a true good old fashioned noir the story dives almost immediately and often into flashbacks that dole out the backstory. The film avoids the usual familiar territory that has been etched out in previous cinematic adaptations, but also effectively revisits the mythos of Batman and the fear surrounding the dark knight that makes him such a fan favourite. Early on in his crime-fighting career, Bruce juggles intimidation tactics and the conflict between the streets and the empty family home - never before has a cinematic Batman skipped the double murder in the alley and instead shown a torn Bruce Wayne bargaining at his parent's grave, struggling to reconcile his promise to clean up Gotham's grime and his desire for romance and a normal life. When he proposes to Andrea he gets more than a telling sign, an ominous column of bats curling and fluttering into the sky like the first ever bat signal. The ending suggests more of the same; that Bruce Wayne and Batman are two separate entities, that only one of them can truly exist in more than empty shape and form, and that other figures have also experienced similar tragedies and conflicts. \n\nThe true success of Phantasm is being able to tie these difficult questions into what the caped crusader is truly beloved for: a hammy superhero with an entire arsenal of gadgets and gizmos who fully embraces what he is. The Batman figure has always been a little bit ridiculous - why not go with it? What will endless vengeance solve? It's a good question for an adult in a bat costume, but aside from trying to answer it, there's also classical action taken straight from the animated series and the comic books they are based on, with the type of hits and blows where you can almost visualise the outlines of the 'KA-POW' on the screen. The set pieces are appropriate; the huge, full moon illuminating the city, and the Batman and his arch-rival posed like giants as they battle in the model future world exhibit. Mark Hamill is the voice behind the excellent Joker, who might be the only super-villain able to make brandishing an electric mixer even remotely menacing. With his wide grimaces and infamous cackle, Hamill turns any fight sequence into a heightened battle of the wits, alternating one-liners and swinging fists. Shirley Walker's brass- heavy theme is reminiscent of Danny Elfman's from the Burton movie, retaining most of its grandiose, darkness and mystery as the opening surveys the city skyline. And Kevin Conroy's steely tones are worthy of being included in the best of the on-screen Batman portrayals. He's just, formidable, unwavering - until he is confronted with a glimpse of a second chance at a different life.",

It tells a heartfelt story about The Dark Knight which wasn't done like THIS before Batman Begins came along: Bruce Wayne was once a young man in love, trying to balance his personal life with that as a vigilante protecting Gotham City. Batman has secrets that he hides just like his identity. Andrea Beaumont is one of those memories Bruce keeps looking back on throughout the movie, and she really did change his life until she had to leave him. Little does Bruce know that she is still affecting his life as Batman: the Phantasm has been killing gangsters in the underworld, and we learn that Andrea is the Phantasm.\n\nThis movie is one of the very best animated films I have seen; I kept re-watching it on VHS in the 90s as a kid, and even now it is still entertaining for me. It compliments the Batman: The Animated Series perfectly while also standing on its own just fine. Mark Hamill is still wonderfully chilling as The Joker's voice, Kevin Conroy IS Batman in this film, and Bob Hastings gives Jim Gordon's minimal role real impact on how Batman affects Gotham-life, being a committed voice of reason.\n\nMask of the Phantasm has a great, emotionally complicated story and enough mystery around it to warrant a second viewing for any first-timers.\n\nIf you loved The Dark Knight Trilogy, want something new and haven't seen this, DON'T MISS OUT!",

In many ways, it was way ahead of its time, daring to be surprisingly gritty and solemn in way in which no other Batman film (Not even those directed by Tim Burton) was before.\n\nThe animation is dark and brooding, the characters are fleshed out and complex, and the plot is very deep and compelling. The viewer is given a true insight into the troubled psyche of Batman, the archetypal Byronic hero and the continuous tribulations that afflict his life as a superhero, from his complicated relationship with Andrea to his inner conflicts with his level of responsibility and his uncertainty that arises from it.\n\nOne scene in particular - in which Bruce kneels at his parents' grave and begs them to let him live his own life - gets me a tad choked up every time I see it. This is powerful, serious drama, as any Batman story should be.\n\nBatman: Mask of the Phantasm is a fantastic film, which I highly recommend to any fan of Batman, the DCAU, and animation in general.",

Sophisticated, dark and somewhat unique, I think it improves on the animation of the series slightly. The colours are bold, and the character designs are sharp and decisive. The music is wonderful too, it is quite a complex score even for Batman but it is always memorable whether it is the choruses or the rousing orchestral music.\n\nThe story is what makes Mask of the Phantasm so good. It is structured similarly to those of some of the plot lines of the series but just as fresh and as compelling with a lot of great scenes particularly the wonderfully poetic opening sequence. The writing is superb, very mature and intelligent, and the pace and characters are spot on. Batman especially is a revelation, dark, brooding and charismatic. The voice acting is terrific, with Kevin Conroy actually embodying the character and Mark Hamill once again phenomenal as Joker.\n\nAll in all, an amazing animated film and one of the best Batman films to date. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

I've always heard good things about it, but I've never gotten around to watching it. This movie might be a bad introduction for me into the series.\n\nTo start off, there's practically no plot here. I mean, yeah, we have Batman (Kevin Conroy) running around and trying to figure out the mystery of who this \"Phantasm\" character is (a new villain created specifically for this movie). The problem is that this villain is completely uninteresting. Only when we learn their secret identity later on in the movie, then they become only somewhat mildly interesting. The Phantasm goes about Grim Reaper style, executing different criminals while telling them \"it's time to die.\" Bruce/Batman also has a love interest here, Andrea Beaumont (Dana Delany), who was also created for this movie. Interesting to see Batman finally try to settle down with a woman, but this doesn't really go anywhere.\n\nAnother issue with the storytelling is that there are so many flashback sequences, a really bland way to tell a story. It's mostly used to give us some context on Bruce and Andrea's relationship. It's very confusing sometimes because there's only a one second dream transition effect that swaps us between flashback and current reality. Maybe if these sequences were in black and white it would have been a little easier to follow. Still doesn't excuse the fact that flashbacks are lazy and boring.\n\nThe saving grace here is Mark Hamill. I've always loved him as the Joker. It's amazing the talent they've had playing that character all these years: Hamill, Nicholson, Ledger, Phoenix. Anyways, Hamill is the best part of this movie.\n\nThe animation is also very nice to look at. It pulls the movie up to passable mediocrity. I also like some of the dark and mature themes here. It's still a kid's movie, so you won't see anything as dark or mature as in something like \"Batman Returns\", but it's cool to know that this movie wasn't strictly intended for children.\n\nThis movie was originally intended to be a direct-to-video release, and it kind of shows. I wrote this review because it kind of shocked me how much praise was being heaped onto it. A mild curiosity for fans, and it offers very little to just about everybody else.",

This is a great movie because it doesn't really reference the show even to make the audience confused as to what is going on. Then again, I guess everyone is so familiar with the Batman mythology there's probably no reason to do that anyway. The best thing about this is the fantastic animation. It makes me miss the days where every beloved animated show got a theatrically released movie based on it, but now most TV shows haven't switched to CGI like movies. It's easily the best movie I've seen for Superhero Month. Another great thing is how well this film works as an origin story.\n\nTrue, it doesn't show Batman's direct origin, but we get to see through flashbacks a gradual change that makes Bruce Wayne don the costume. It's great to see him actually propose to someone, although we all know it didn't work out. I had in fact heard of the twist ending, but it's still tons of fun to watch. It truly did remind me of the classic Max Fleischer superhero cartoons and how beautifully animated they were (although they did stuff with Superman, not Batman). My only complaint is that the movie is too short! It was so epic I wanted to see more! Still, it's definitely worth your time and probably my second favorite Batman movie next to \"The Dark Knight\". ***1/2",

        "reviewText": "Batman: The Animated Series is superb, one of the best TV shows I've ever seen. It is incredibly consistent in quality with its excellent writing, voice-acting, animation and music (really powerful and gorgeous). New characters were created (Harley Quinn), deeper back- stories were developed (Mr. Freeze) and countless other ideas were first seen in this series to later become an integral part of the Batman mythology. Its tone found a perfect midpoint between the darkness usually associated with Batman and a children's action cartoon; both adults and kids can enjoy it. And this feature film lives up to all of those standards in a very satisfying way.\n\nThere are many twists and turns in the plot of Batman: Mask of the Phantasm. Like The Usual Suspects, you'll probably think you're clever for guessing certain things only to find you were way off the mark. The story is original although the Phantasm is apparently based on the Reaper from Batman: Year Two. There are many flashbacks that give insight into Bruce's personal evolution and struggle as Batman. They tie-in to the events of the movie naturally.\n\nThere are many little moments of humour, especially between Alfred and Bruce (or when Bruce is in public with his playboy persona). Their banter is often understated and hilarious. It's not based on shallow gags but centred on the characters so it has a long-term resonance. The more you see of them, the stronger and more entertaining their relationship becomes.\n\nThe action is really well done. It's not just the same every time, there's always creativity like in a James Bond or Jackie Chan movie. Batman might have to avoid the police while also chasing a suspect or grab and use an unexpected weapon or dodge bombs thrown at him or have to create an impromptu distraction, etc. All the same, he still manages to constantly beat up thugs and outsmart his opponents. And of course, he always has to find a way to fight without ever killing anyone, his most fundamental rule.\n\nSpeaking of which, the film-makers are clearly passionate about Batman and all of the mythology and fiction that's been created over the years about him and Gotham. They are true to it, honour and respect what they like best about it and regularly take it in new and interesting directions.\n\nThis is actually a fairly sad and reflective movie. There's plenty of action but it has personal themes and probably more depth than a first viewing would allow one to properly absorb. And that's infinitely better than if it was just another entertaining but typical action movie. It will surely continue to grow in stature over time. Batman is perhaps the most popular superhero of all time (he's certainly my favourite) and here he is aptly represented in a very original and self-contained story. It's rare for love, expertise and talent to come together like this.",

        "reviewText": "Batman has always been my all time favorite superhero besides Superman, Spider Man, Hulk, Wolverine and many other superheros. Now, \"Batman: Mask of the Phantasm\" is not only the best Batman animated movie, but it is one of my favorite Batman movies along side with Tim Burton's classic 1989 movie and the awesome trilogy by Christopher Nolan. This movie gets so overlooked, and it deserves to be talked about as it has already become a cult classic. The movie centers around Bruce Wayne's past about as he once had a love one named Andre Beaumont as they were going to spend the rest of their lives together. Sadly, Andre breaks up with Bruce as he now turns himself into the Dark Knight to fight crime. During the present, the mysterious figure known as the Phantasm hunts down some of the crime bosses as Batman is being framed and goes out to find who the Phantasm really is. What can I say? Of course, you know the movie is based on a popular animated TV series which it is without a doubt one of the greatest animated shows about Batman. The movie is definitely larger than life as the movie went into theaters instead of being straight to video as it was originally intended. The movie open to great reviews, but did not perform well at the box-office due to how bad the marketing went. However, it did well for being success as it was first released on both VHS and Laser discs. I have it on VHS, and now I have it on DVD. Unfortunately, it has never been released on Blu-Ray yet which I will get to that later. I thought the animation is incredible as it does add a stylish look into as it represents what the comic books were. Also, the story is perfectly well told for showing the psychology of Bruce Wayne and following the path of becoming Gotham's greatest protector. The direction by Eric Radomski and Bruce W. Timm is absolutely top notch perfect. The voice acting is indeed perfect. Kevin Conroy does a heck of a job to voice both Bruce Wayne and Batman, as well as Mark Hamill for voicing the Joker. Of course, the late Gene Siskel from Siskel&Ebert did not like Hamill's voice, but that is his opinion. At least both Siskel and Roger Ebert gave the movie a two thumbs up which it deserves to. Dana Delany has also done a great job for voicing Bruce Wayne's love interest. The movie is 76 minutes long which it does go by at a very good pace, when it does keep you interest with the story and characters. I do love Shirley Walker's music which it is whether or not one of her greatest achievements. Now, about this movie for not being released on Blu Ray. Like Disney's remake of \"Mighty Joe Young,\" the movie does need another release on DVD as well as an official release on Blu Ray; it needs a heck of a restoration for cleaning up the movie's transfer, but no DNR like what Fox did to \"Predator\" because if it did then it will loose some of its textures and details. Warner Bros. needs to be faithful on how this movie looks, and maybe have it be supervised by Bruce W. Timm and some of the people that work on this movie. Also, the DVD only has a trailer but no audio commentary from the cast and crew as well as having deleted scenes, still galleries, maybe other trailers and TV spots and most of all a documentary on how the film was when it came to make a Batman animated feature film as it went from straight to video to theaters, and how the marketing turned out to be a huge disappointment but thanks to the fans for having it become a cult film. There is a petition that I found online, which I did sign it and I hope that Warner Bros. release this movie on DVD again, and making an official Blu Ray release with an all new video transfer with sound and an amount of special features. If you aren't interested to sign it, that is fine and I am not going to be upset or anything like that. I just want this to be release as soon as possible. If you are interest, then that will be wonderful. I will put the link on it whether you are interest to sign the petition to have this movie be released on Blu Ray. With that said, \"Batman: Mask of the Phantasm\" is the most absolute Batman animated movie of all time, and it will continue to be a classic movie. I give it a 10 out of 10.\n\nHere is the link for the petition: http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/release-batman-mask-of-the- phantasm-on-blu-ray \n\nFor a reminder, if the link has issues just type the movie's name with petition on Google so that it will take you there.

At the same time, an old love of Bruce Wayne's has returned to town and brings back memories of Bruce's early pre-Batman days and how close he came to never becoming the crime fighter he is today. Also, the Joker figures into the plot nicely. The best Batman animated movie to date. Not surprising since this came out as the brilliant \"Batman: The Animated Series\" was on television redefining awesome. If you loved that series, you will love this. \n\nIt's not perfect. The identity of the Phantasm is fairly obvious despite their red herring attempts. But it captures what made the series work so well: the appeal to both kids and adults by using simple storytelling devices and animation but still being intelligent and emotional enough to make it more than just mindless action or silliness. The main problem with most of the DCAU movies today is that they can't seem to strike that right balance anymore. They're either too dumb for adults to like or too hyper-violent and crass for kids to even be watching. Mostly they seem to settle on only appealing to teenage boys. But the '90s series had cross-generational appeal and this movie is a good appetizer for that main course.",

Despite being a feature-length narrative, it doesn't discard its original roots, and is a deliriously dark adventure crafted with style & composure.\n\nThere is enough mystery & action in the final print to keep the interest alive, and the several flashbacks it has in store only add extra depth to the events unfolding in the present. However, the nonlinear arrangement could've used a bit more streamlining. Its 75 mins runtime is finely paced, and voice work from the actors is commendable.\n\nOverall, Batman: Mask of the Phantasm remains one of the best portraits of Batman on film, features a better quality story than most of its live-action counterparts and is more than capable of surprising the newcomers even today. One doesn't need to be well-versed with the animated series to enjoy this film, but it does enrich the viewing experience by a slight margin. A definite recommend.",

      "text": "A meeting between crime lord Chuckie Sol (Dick Miller) and his cronies starts one night in Gotham City. Sol is instructing his men about the procedure for laundering some new counterfeit bills through their casino when the meeting is interrupted by the Batman. Batman takes out Sols' followers but Chuckie manages to get to the parking garage.\n\nSol is greeted by a mysterious figure (who he first mistakes for Batman) stating the phrase \"Your Angel of Death awaits.\" This mysterious Phantasm (voiced by Stacey Keach) is nearly run down by Sol's car, but tricks Sol into driving out a nearby window to his death. Batman arrives on the scene and observes Sol; the people below see Batman and assume he is responsible for what has happened.\n\nNext morning, Councilman Arthur Reeves (Hart Bochner) is giving a press conference about Batman's apparent actions. He wants to hunt down Batman and arrest the vigilante. Commissioner James Gordon (Bob Hastings) is against it, since he doesn't believe Batman would do something like that. Detective Harvey Bullock (Robert Costanzo), on the other hand, is in favor of stopping Batman.\n\nAlfred (Efrem Zimbalist Jr.) and Bruce (Kevin Conroy) are watching the presentation in the Batcave. Batman is analyzing a chemical found on the glass from Chuckie Sol's car.\n\nCouncilman Arthur is in his office, talking to a woman (Dana Delany) on the phone. She's flying into town after being gone for 10 years to settle some old finances.\n\nDuring a party at Wayne Manor, Bruce confronts Arthur about his Batman stance. Arthur counters with some remarks about Bruce's love life, and mentions the name of one woman from Bruce's past- Andrea Beaumont.\n\nBruce confronts the portrait of his parents, flashing back to his memory of meeting Andrea in the graveyard while they both visited dead relatives (Andrea with her mother, Bruce with his parents). They both talk about how they miss their families. Bruce slyly mentions that he made a vow to his parents upon their death, and that \"so far\" he has kept it.\n\nThe night after meeting Andrea, Bruce goes out crime-fighting for the first time in his life. Decked out in a simple mask and street clothes, he confronts a group of thieves. Bruce is able to fend them off, but the thieves do not treat him as a serious threat.\n\nNext morning, after bandaging his wounds, Bruce exercises while talking to Alfred. Bruce thinks that he failed to keep control of the situation because the criminals weren't afraid of him. Andrea arrives to speak with Bruce, and before long the two have begun a romantic relationship. The flashback ends and Bruce goes back out to the party.\n\nAnother Gotham crime lord, Buzz Bronski (John P. Ryan) visits the grave of Chuckie Sol. He hears the mysterious voice repeating \"Your Angel of Death Awaits\"- the Phantasm has come for Bronski. Phantasm kills Bronski by pushing a huge stone angel onto him. Buzz's bodyguards see a caped figure walking away from the scene and assume it is the Batman.\n\nElderly crime boss Salvatore Valestra (Abe Vigoda) reads the obituary of Buzz Bronski and the news story about Batman being thought responsible for the crimes. He is shocked at the news.\n\nArthur is now more fanatical than ever in his crusade against Batman. Commissioner Gordon vehemently refuses to participate, so Bullock eagerly steps up.\n\nAfter Batman collects evidence at the scene of Buzz Bronski's murder, he takes a brief moment to reflect at the graveside of his parents. Andrea Beaumont is also in the graveyard; she spots a figure at the Wayne graves and automatically assumes that it is Bruce.\n\nAndrea has dinner with Councilman Reeves, her mind distracted by what she saw that night. Batman observes her on stakeout. This triggers another flashback- Bruce takes Andrea to the Gotham World Fair, observing several prototype inventions- including a distinctive looking car. Andrea invites Bruce to come and meet her father, and he agrees. Bruce voices his discomfort to Alfred; his relationship with Andrea wasn't something he's planned on.\n\nBruce & Andrea greet Carl Beaumont, who is just finishing business with Arthur Reeves (Reeves works for Beaumont's legal department at this time). The meeting is interrupted by Valestra, who wants to speak with Carl. Both Bruce & Andrea are suspicious of Valestra.\n\nBruce spots a street merchant being robbed by a motorcycle gang. He goes after them, but his concern for Andrea distracts him and they get away.\n\nThat night, Bruce tries to design a costume for himself but cannot continue. Bruce knows that he can't complete the vow he made to his parents with someone like Andrea in his life. Bruce goes to his parents' grave site to try and justify his feelings. Andrea meets him and they go home together.\n\nWhen a police helicopter approaches the nearby roof, Batman is brought out of his memory trip and returns home.\n\nNext day, Councilman Reeves is approached by Valestra. Reeves confirms that Batman is apparently attacking \"their people.\"\n\nUsing the Bat-Computer, Batman confirms that the two dead men- Sol & Bronski- were partners in phony dummy corporations set up at least 10 years ago. There was a third man involved- Sal Valestra. Batman goes off to confront Valestra. Alfred asks if Bruce will see Andrea when he is done.\n\nIn Valestra's office, Batman finds a photo of Carl Beaumont with Valestra and the two dead men. This triggers yet another flashback- Bruce proposes to Andrea and she happily accepts. They are interrupted by a huge swarm of bats coming from a cave below the house. Andrea returns to her father's house to see that some people have arrived to speak with Carl. She goes inside to tell her father the good news.\n\nBruce explores the cave and marvels at its huge size. When he returns, Alfred solemnly hands him a package. Andrea has returned Bruce's ring, stating only that she is leaving town and encouraging Bruce to forget her. Bruce, heartbroken, throws himself back into \"The Plan.\" That very night, he dons the Batsuit for the first time. Alfred, seeing the transformation from Bruce to Batman, can only watch and remark \"My God!\"\n\nValestra goes to the now abandoned World Fair, which is a hideout for the Joker (Mark Hamil), who greets him like an old friend. Valestra tells him that he thinks Batman is killing off members of \"the old gang.\" Joker notes that this is uncharacteristic behavior for Batman, and insists he is not a hired gun for the mob. Valestra reminds him that if the vigilante is specifically targeting his old associates, then its only a matter of time before they go after the Joker.\n\nAndrea ends her date with Arthur, and finds Batman in her room. He asks about the men photographed with her father, but she tells him nothing. Denying any connection, Andrea states that Batman is the only one there who is still controlled by his parents.\n\nThe Phantasm comes to Valestra's apartment, only to find that Sal has been given a lethal dose of Joker toxin. Joker, watching from a hidden camera, is shocked to see that the killer isn't really Batman. The Phantasm narrowly escapes a bomb set by the Joker.\n\nBatman confronts the Phantasm on the rooftop. A police helicopter confronts Batman, and Phantasm uses the chance to escape. Batman hides out in a construction site, but is soon able to trick the police into attacking a phony target (losing his cape & cowl in the process). Andrea drives up as Batman is fleeing and offers him a getaway vehicle. They elude the police.\n\nAlfred bandages Bruce's wounds while he talks to Andrea. She tells Bruce about what happened the night he proposed. A flashback reveals that Carl Beaumont is begging for his life in front of Valestra's men. Andrea walks in, and her life is jeopardized too. Valestra gives Carl 24 hours to return the money that was embezzled or Carl will die. Andrea opposes her fathers actions and does not wish to run, but Carl insists that there is no hope for them in Gotham.\n\nIn the present, Andrea tells Bruce that her father was eventually able to pay off his debt, but Valestra's men considered it too little, too late. Bruce thinks that the man in the Phantasm costume is Carl- killing off the gangsters to finally be free of his debt. Bruce & Andrea are obviously still in love, but Bruce states that he still has to stop the Phantasm.\n\nBruce looks at the photo he took from Valestra again. He recognizes the features on one man, and-after an alteration with red ink- confirms that Valestra's former bodyguard is actually The Joker!\n\nCouncilman Reeves is furious that Batman escaped. The Joker confronts Reeves and talks about what's been happening, mentioning that someone other than Batman is responsible for the killings. Joker doses Reeves with his laughing toxin, and Arthur is hospitalized in a hysterical laughing fit.\n\nBatman confronts Reeves that night, confirming the details about Reeve's connection to the Beaumonts. Arthur kept in touch with Carl while he was abroad, helping to set up funds. But when Reeves asked Carl for help in financing an election, Carl refused. So, desperate for funds, Arthur sold Carl out to Valestra's mob.\n\nBatman searches Andrea's apartment for more clues, finding a locket with a picture of Andrea & himself inside. The phone rings and Batman answers it- it's the Joker, sending another bomb into the apartment. Batman manages to escape and recognizes the design of the plane that flew in the bomb. He deduces that Joker is hiding out in the ruins of the Gotham World Fair.\n\nIn a final flashback, Andrea returns to her father's new home after some grocery shopping, only to find Valestra's bodyguard emerging. Fearing the worst, she drops the grocery bags and runs. As Andrea screams in horror, the future Joker grabs an apple out of the discarded grocery bags, then casually walks away.\n\nPhantasm confronts Joker, and Joker applauds the Phantasm's scheme. Phantasm is revealed to be Andrea Beaumont, out for revenge against her father's murderers. Batman arrives and confronts Andrea, who states that vengeance is now all that she has left. Batman and Joker fight, eventually triggering a fire in the World's Fair props. Andrea grabs Joker, vowing that her crusade will end no matter what. She disappears in an explosion, but Batman manages to get away.\n\nIn the Batcave, Bruce regrets not being able to save Andrea. Alfred states that it is quite possible Andrea didn't want to be saved. A glimmer in the cave attracts Bruce's attention- he finds the same locket from Andrea's apartment.\n\nOut on a cruise, Andrea gazes out at the sea, truly alone in the world."

It's dialogue-faithful, the tone is good, and really, if they've gotten Conroy and Hamill as the two leads, you know they're taking this seriously. And that infamous scene is incredibly effective.\n\nBut it's that first half-hour that doesn't work. It's tacked-on and certainly doesn't do Batgirl or Batman any favors (the latter of whom just seems a tad creepy). This is (for better or worse) the Joker's origin story, incendiary though it is, and I can understand why they'd want to flesh out Barbara's character; but it still doesn't work because Batman doesn't recall her horrific fate later on in the movie. She's no longer relevant beyond the shock value. The intentions were there, but it could've been done better.\n\nWithin this running time, there are 45 minutes of good movie. Skip the first 30 and you don't miss a thing.\n\n6/10",

        "reviewText": "One of the most acclaimed graphic novels of all time has now come to the big screen. Not only is this one of the most acclaimed novels ever but it's one of the most controversial. The story is basically an origin tale for the infamous Batman villain, The Joker. When this movie was initially announced back at the beginning of 2016 there was some serious hype surrounding it. Especially when it received an R rating. One thing that really made me nervous though was how quickly this actually released. Obviously, it could've been in production long before it was announced back at the beginning of the year, but after seeing the film, I don't think that's the case.\n\nThe first thirty minutes of the film is a kind of prelude involving, mostly, Batgirl. It talks about how she came to quit being said superhero and draws a thread between her and Batman. Now, this story is controversial for a reason. Not only does it explore tough themes but it shows the details of these horrible things. The story in the graphic novel is brutal, uncompromising, and pretty tough to get through.\n\nHowever the film is just the opposite. It tries hard to retell the story seen in the novel, yet any emotional drama is all but lost. This mainly has to do with the length of the film itself. Being only 80 minutes, it's rather short. As I said, the first thirty minutes revolves around Batgirl. And this segment of time is absolutely the worst to sit through. It's tedious, overly long, and so clich√© and predictable that there's nothing remotely enjoyable.\n\nWhile, this part of the film is undoubtedly the worst from a storytelling standpoint, there are a number of things that remained consistently bad throughout. Most notably was the animation. From a studio like Warner Bros you'd expect some decent art work, but not here. The back drops nor art design is well put together. It's clunky, with no style to be found.\n\nIt looks like they took the animation from a rough draft of the animated series and colored it in. This issue becomes even more clear whenever it attempts 3D animation. The other blaring issue that continues through the film is the music. Which is completely contrived and formulated to the point of it being so clich√© that is, in fact not clich√©.\n\nAs the film ended, a crowd that once cheered for the lights dimming, was left in stunned silence. Not a good stunned silence like you get after watching 'Gone Girl', this type of silence is the kind where people don't know what they just saw. For me, this had to do with the complete lack of any emotional resonance. When it attempts to recreate the power of the novel it fails. \n\nIt doesn't commit enough to the drama of the story. Even with its R rating it doesn't draw the same toughness the novel does. It lacks the rawness that the novel has to make it's audience queasy. It's not graphic enough to be disturbing and it's not lighthearted enough to be fun. It just bounces from scene to scene with little connecting one to another. The best way to describe it is that it goes from this scene to that scene and than it ends. That's about it. ‚ÄãThis is one film that should have been great. All the pieces are there. It has a great studio behind it, an excellent voice team, and a brilliant story. But it lacks the emotional power that the novel has. Even though it has its R rating it doesn't fully commit to it, or anything for that matter. Without coherent direction and the overall first draft vibe of the film it's hardly the experience we've been lead to believe it is.",

        "reviewText": "It may seem like this is a high rating given the backlash DC animated The Killing Joke has received, however this is an averaged out rating. ¬†In honesty this isn't a very good movie, despite the fact that when the filmmakers and adapter Brian Azzarello (do I hasten to call him a 'screenwriter' after this one credit?) stick to the original Alan Moore source it's a dark and involving delight. It's what comes before it, how they make it into a \"full movie\" that things fall apart. ¬†This is a schizophrenic experience full of high highs, generic lows and some what the almighty Jesus bloody hell for good measure.\n\nAnd I get what they tried to do or felt they had to do as far as making it a complete experience as a 75 minute film. ¬†Barbara Gordon, aka Batgirl, is more of a plot device in the comic (spoiler? Joker shoots and paralyzed her before kidnapping Commissioner for his amusement park nightmare games), so to flesh out her backstory with Batman is good. On paper. ¬†Actually, not on this paper, as it turns into a half hour story where Batgirl is chasing after a ho-Hum \"charming\" criminal who I don't even recall in the comics (if he was in it he's certainly not memorable) and it's all here to make it a Batgirl story with Batman mostly as the ornery father figure...\n\nWhich makes that 'thing' that happens between them so jarring; if this was squarely a batman/batgirl story theoretically it could go somewhere )I'm not saying it's a good idea in most any context, again those like Robin or Batgirl are more like the kids to Batman not those he gets uh down n dirty with). ¬†But Azzarello crams it in where it doesn't fit and if anything makes the motivations for what comes in the actual Killing Joke story hamfisted. ¬†Not to mention how it's presented is silly especially given what room is open with an R rating (the first for any Batman film, ironically you could show this to most kids 12 and up and it'd be fine).\n\nDespite this troubling and/or just typical Batman/Batgirl story that squanders potential with really delving into backstory the comic hinted at, or because of it, when that second half of the film kicks in to gear and we get the story of the comic it'S presented largely faithfully and the genius and power of that story comes through; the Joker as a 'sympathetic' being with his own origin story which, by the end, is satisfying as its own story and is brilliant as a circumspect narrative from an unreliable storyteller.\n\nI may also be a sucker for Hamill as the Joker but how can one not be when he always sinks his teeth in and makes him a real PRESENCE in a room? ¬†Adding to this he creates a good, relatable voice for pre.transformation Joker in the flashbacks and we get drawn in to his story in large part because that voice acting comes through. ¬†The animation is also top notch (as far as the limited budget allows), and some moments in that fun-house/amusement park are shown to be iconic for a reason; if you get any allusions to the Burton 89 Batman there's a reason for that.\n\nI think my high rating is due to finding that main story so compelling - what a hero or villain means when they have to face existential questions and how they relate to one another through \"one bad day\" (interestingly though Moore recently says he doesn't like his own work here I find he underrated it, that he got under the skin of these iconic figures to show them as people). ¬†So I ¬†wanted it to be great, and it flirts with being as strong as the first part of the Dark Knight Returns movie or even Mask of the Phantasm. ¬†But that first half hour drags it into a murky, middle feeling where overall you come away saying 'it's alright, I guess,' with an ambiguous ending not landed with the weight that's required either.",

        "reviewText": "The Killing Joke (that is the graphic novel written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Brian Bolland) is considered one of the definitive Batman/Joker stories ever told. It's a controversial one to be sure as well with what Moore chose to do to one of its supporting characters. So when it was announced that it was, at last, receiving a screen adaptation, fans couldn't help but be excited. When the news came that one of the definitive Batman/Joker performance teams (Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill) were playing those roles, it was even harder to be excited. So much so that despite being slated to go straight to DVD, it received a successful yet brief cinema run as well. Was it to prove to be as successful as its original comic counterpart? \n\nYes and no.\n\nLet's look at the 'no' side of the equation first, shall we? The problem is the film's opening half hour which focuses heavily on Batgirl aka Barbara Gordon (voiced by Tara Strong). Instead of feeling a natural extension of the original Alan Moore tale (which takes up some forty five minutes of screen time), it instead ends up feeling tacked on like the longest ever James Bond style pre-credit sequence. Worse, it has not a single connection to the actual plot and does nothing to really develop the characters it does involve except in trivial ways. The perfect example being a rooftop confrontation between Batman and Batgirl that ends up with a legitimate \"what was the writer thinking?!\" moment. That said, it's not bad and wouldn't have necessarily been a bad short film on its own but glued into Killing Joke, it pales by comparison. \n\nThat said, once it got beyond that opening half hour and into actually doing what it sets out to do, it works and works bloody well. Writer Brian Azzarello turns the original Moore (who for his own reasons has been uncredited on a number of works adapted from him for years now) into a full functioning script laying out the narratives of the Joker wounding Batgirl, trying to drive Gordon insane, and confront the Batman while also looking at the day that made the Joker into the man he is. It's also played out just as Moore wrote it and Bolland illustrated it in all of its unsettling glory.\n\nAll of which is anchored by the ever excellent DC animated production values. The voice acting is everything would hope for it to be from Conroy's Batman to what might very well be Mark Hamill's best performance as the Joker. Whatever else one cay say about the film, Hamill shines as one of the definitive Joker performers gets to bring to life perhaps the definitive tale of the character and Hamill does it wonderfully from one line to the next, showing the tragedy that comes to underline the character. The supporting does well though those in the first half hour do as well as might be expected with the material they're handed including Ray Wise as Commissioner Gordon, Strong's Batgirl, and Robin Atkin Downes as Detective Harvey Bullock. It's a solid cast to say the least.\n\nThe animation is also solid. While it never quite manages to catch the same realistic and neo-noir tones of Bolland's illustrations, it does presents something that is a close match for it. Even better for comic fans, the film recreates some of the iconic panels from the original comic splendidly. For the most part, the DC animated films have had good animation and this one is no exception to that rule.\n\nIn a way though, despite what the film does successfully, it feels like it doesn't quite live up to expectations. In large part, that comes down to the underwhelming opening half hour which stands in stark contrast with just how good the remainder of it is. In a sense then, it's a a shame they stuck that prologue onto it because this might have been among the best comic screen adaptations otherwise. What it is instead is nearly 2/3 of one and 1/3 of something that's watchable but not as good as it ought to have been.",

        "reviewText": "I've always thought that The Killing Joke is actually not long enough and not quite suitable enough for big screen. This just proves it.\n\nThere's a lot of padding to extend the run time. First 20-ish minutes are brand new stuff, not from the comic book. It deals with Barbara and her relationship with Batman. Also, they have sex. Yeah, so, moving on. \n\nI guess that new stuff had purpose to extend the run time and maybe add some more character to Barbara, to make the later stuff more impactful. But somehow it (new stuff) becomes totally disconnected from the rest. Again, the comic didn't have that much material to put into an hour plus long movie. So while it does fill the time, it doesn't add much or subtracts from the whole picture. Although, that sex scene was a bit unnecessary.\n\nThere are few more fillers along the way and they are also in that \"nor adding, nor subtracting anything from the whole\" formula. \n\nEnding was a bit weird too. While it will be an eternal debate about \"did Batman strangled Joker or not?\", in the comic, that last page ended perfectly, they both laugh, then they both stop, and you can only \"hear\" incoming cop sirens. Here, similar, only we hear Batman weird laugh extending into fade to end credits. While a small thing, it kinda annoyed me. Also, there's a mid credits stinger, which was also out of place and felt a bit unnecessary.\n\nNow, it's nothing new that Alan Moore doesn't want to have anything with transferring his stories to big screen, here they skipped him completely and credited Brian Azzarello for story. I guess he did the best he could to expand the story to fit into an hour and 15 minutes animated feature. Only those fillers were kind of whatever.\n\nVoice acting and all that, Mark Hamill, Kevin Conroy, Tara Strong, Nolan North.. all the good stuff about that. Music, also fine. What I want to write a bit more about is animation. Now I'm aware how painful process of animating can be but here we got DC average animation to DVD/BR home feature - bit stiff, not much texture to the world and characters but passable. It could (should) be way better though. \n\nDirecting was OK but I can't shake the feeling that a bit of quality directing and editing would make this thing a whole lot better. But it's OK.\n\nAnd that's the running theme here - OK. Good but not great. In the end it was just another DC animated straight to DVD/BR feature and not exactly suited for the big screen. I would be OK if they never made this, but I'm OK with this as well but it could be better, as I already said. I expected more, was fine with what I got... but... I expected more dammit.",

I guess it's easy to see why so many positive vibes would go towards this animated film and especially since so many people were unhappy with BATMAN VS SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE. With that said, as good as this film is I still think it has been overrated by some who are calling it a masterpiece.\n\nStill, there's no question that this is a highly entertaining movie that manages to keep you glued to the personal drama effecting Batman and there's also the great rivalry with the Joker. These aspects is what keeps the film moving at such a good pace and I really thought the Joker character was highly entertaining and sinister just the way he should be. Mark Hamill does a very good job with the vocal work on the Joker and I thought Tara Strong was also very good with Batgirl.\n\nThe animation is top notch as you'd expect and the screenplay allowed the darkness of the city to blend in with the characters. This darker approach is something that \"some\" people don't like but I thought it was perfectly suited for the animation.

It was one of the most disturbing, nightmarish made in UK stories, that gave an even more psychish tone to Joker as a character and turned (unfortunately) eventually Batgirl into Oracle.\n\nThe graphic novel is only 64 pages long, more like a special-sized story, thus DC decided to write more script, in order to be adapted into a full movie. And that is the breaking point.\n\nTHE KILLING JOKE SHOULD BE A 30' SPECIAL, NOT THIS ABNORMAL SNOOZEFEST THAT LASTS OVER AN HOUR! They could adapt additionally another short Bat story and release the equivalent of \"Hulk VS\", in order to fill the disc time. Although we are years now in digital form and 60' is an ill- forgotten excuse for \"minimum time limit\".\n\nThe first half of this raped adaptation is a generic adventure of Batgirl, in which...\n\nMAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD\n\n...she is a young lady that feels useless and loves Batman. Thus, enter Batsex. These 30' theoretically supposed to make us love her character. Personally, it was horrendous and with a major luck of respect to her character. The worst Batgirl story ever. A young naive Batgirl that is useless and eventually bangs Batman as her mentor...\n\nThen, as of a sudden, Killing Joke strikes. The transition is awkward, bad and the tone is out of scale compared to the first half. OK, it is a good adaptation, but it is so uneven to the first half that you are already tired. Although, the frames sometimes have a pace problem.\n\nIN A NUTSHELL, it is a bad prolonged adaptation and you should skip the first 30' for your own mental sake.",

Pity it wasn't with better material.\n\nThe script is, to put it kindly, uneven - occasional snatches of Moore's original dialogue jarring badly with Brian Azzarello's. This is the biggest problem with this piece. Azzarello writes like Azzarello, and Azzarello's OWN stuff (his crime and mob stories especially) is excellent - but his tinkering with other peoples' stuff is dire. His fleshing out of this story - almost all of the first half the film is an unnecessary prologue which objectifies Barbara Gordon/Batgirl and defines her purely in terms of her relationships with male characters - is unsubtle, and misses the point of the original piece. If I hadn't seen Azzarello's name on the box-cover I might have thought Frank Miller was involved!\n\nThere is, of course, an element of objectification in the original story, as the brutalised Commissioner Gordon is forced to look at naked images of his paralysed daughter. This was shocking in '80s comics, and is still unsettling and unpleasant...which was rather the point: We should be uncomfortable. We should be outraged. As far as The Joker is concerned Babs IS an object. A means-to-a punchline. Collateral damage. He presents her damaged, naked form to her father BECAUSE it is so wrong that, by his reckoning, it MUST drive Gordon insane. We recognise, though, that the villain's skewed objectification of her is wrong, and, though driven to the edge, Gordon remains sane. It's a messy, brutal plot-twist which outraged many at the time, but it SHOULD outrage us.\n\nSetting Babs up as the sex interest of both the Batman (like a sloppy co-ed with a crush on her teacher) and of a disposable Joker- lite villain in the first half of Azzarello's script means that she is objectified by characters and audience alike, and this alters our reading of her as the tale develops.",

Even some of their generally lesser efforts are entertaining and still enjoyable.\n\nTimm also worked on the great Justice League animated series, Batman: Beyond, and of course the original Batman: The Animated Series, which helped pave the way for all of DC's animated productions. \n\nIt goes without saying that Bruce Timm knows the Batman character and what drives him, and what Batman stories need to be told, so that's why this recent adaptation of Alan Moore's classic 80's graphic novel: The Killing Joke, is such a disappointment. \n\nIf you haven't read the Killing Joke, do yourself a favor, and go ahead and do that now, if you're in any way a fan of the Batman character. It's not the most comfortable read, but gives insight to how dark the world of Batman is meant to be.\n\nThe Killing Joke features a great misunderstanding of the themes of the story, and a lackluster and dull set of production values to go along with that thematic miss. \n\nThe animation is the first thing that turned me off to this piece. Unlike the fluid fight scenes and lush colors of The Dark Knight Returns, or the sharp, defined shapes of Under the Red Hood, The Killing Joke has awful character designs and flat, bland colors, with vehicles rendered in a 3D that looks like bad Playstation 1 graphics. None of the fight scenes, which are often a crowning achievement for DC animated, have any intensity or true kinetic action to them. Whenever the characters are still, you can truly see the lack of detail in the designs, which makes the characters look very plain.\n\nAs far as the story, the movie takes the worst possible turn you could by adding a whole 30 minutes of story and background centered around Batgirl that is plodding, dull, and feels like a totally different story and style than when they arrive at the Alan Moore material over halfway into the movie. They use direct dialouge from the Alan Moore material, some of which felt awkward and strange-sounding spoken aloud, especially contrasting with the much different sounding dialouge of the first act of the movie. One of the spoilers I'll mention here is this clunky first act ending in Batgirl having a totally out of place sex scene with Batman. I gave up hope on enjoying this animated film at that moment, since I knew they had totally departed from the comic book's vision of the story, already muddling the story with irrelevant events, and then making it worse by confusing the relationship of two of the characters.\n\nBatman and Batgirl have a parental relationship, like between him and Robin, where he mentors, trains, and sometimes keeps her in check, as Batman is an uncompromising character who always does things his way. This scene served no purpose in the story, and makes it seem as if he's going after the Joker because Barbara is his lover, not because of the tragic events that happen. \n\nOn top of all of this, I didn't feel that the original novel's ambiguous ending translated to an animated format. They didn't build the tension of anything that happened in the movie, it all just kind of came and went. \n\nEven the fantastic voices of Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill don't really have the same usual enthusiasm here. They still have a great sound for the characters, but the intense feeling you get from hearing those portrayals at their best, in past material, just wasn't here. I have to say that especially Kevin Conroy felt like he was phoning it in, which pains me to say as he is the definitive Batman voice in my opinion. The rest of the voice cast is forgettable, with some especially stilted lines from the actor playing Gordon, who's supposed to go through some very serious, harrowing events here. It's a shame that Bryan Cranston wasn't available again for the role.\n\nOverall, the poor animation, terrible and blundering writing, and the mediocre voices contribute to a very dull and flat telling of what should be a dark, disturbing, and uncompromising Batman story. What we're left with in return is a product that makes me think this story really should be left in the comics.\n\nBatman: The Killing Joke gets a 4 out of 10, only for the continued commitment of Conroy and Hamill. Let's hope that this isn't their final work together in these parts.",

        "reviewText": "I'm not sure how to approach this movie. I wanted to like this movie I really did. I wanted to like everything about it. From its revival of the good old' Batman TAS to the voice actors to the sweeping soundtrack, the polished animation reflecting a dark Art Deco Gothic ‚Äì whatever the hell you call it ‚Äì STYLE. Maybe I was asking for too much but perhaps a little story on the side too. Pretty please? \n\nThat being said, I also slapped a big 'REALISTIC Expectations' sticker over my eyes before watching the screen come alive. I knew this wasn't going to be as good as Batman: The Animated Series. But I was glad to have something reminiscent of that monolith of 1990's animation and storytelling. Boy was I in for a surprise. \n\nThe core issue of this movie is not the A) story it chose to tell or B) how it told said story but rather C) the juxtaposition of a classic show's established world (including its location, characters and story) with a modern flavor. Telling a new story that kind of breaks the older established world we all fell in love with on the TV screen. Then yes we have the story itself, a dark telling of how the joker became to be, without Warner Bros. censorship. This complicates things a bit. So without further ado, let's go down the list! \n\nIssue #1: Old World with new rules that break it. \n\nReally jarring, adds a new dimension of sex that was apparently very crucial to the story (or not). Enter strong powerful female figure defined by her sexuality, hit on by every hot criminal she meets, then making kinky love to Batman on rooftops with creepy goblins looking over (\"it's only sex!\") Definitely not a shallow character, no shortage of hot gay library friends and definitely loads of problems like deciding which guy she wants to be with. Let's see what's behind door number one ‚Äì BATMAN. \n\nWho is Batman? In this movie, he's pretty much a Zoltar of lazy story exposition. Says the most obvious things. Has no inner conflict. Has no fears. Has no emotions no feelings yet in the end we are supposed to feel his turmoil in fighting the Joker. Batman ladies and gents, is purely a device in this film. Batgirl was fan-service. And the movie spent a good 40 minutes setting up her love story to Batman when all of this information could've been relayed in a few key scenes! Why didn't this happen? Because the real star of the show got pushed out ‚Äì the Joker! \n\nWasn't the story about the Joker more than anything? He isn't a witty clever funny man anymore. Now he's just misunderstood and 10x darker than Nolan's version. Although voiced by Hamill, he doesn't even compare to the TAS Joker who lit up the screen. Going to credit this to mediocre writing. Obvious things (90% Batman lines), dumb things (35% Batgirl lines) and unfunny things (75% Joker lines) should not exist. Make your dialogue interesting and worth quoting!\n\nThese flat characters, the story's misplaced focus on character and conflict arise from the core issues ‚Äì the new Batman, complete with its sexy fan-service, empty brooding heroes and second-rate comic relief ‚Äì just cannot exist in this world. A Killing Joke is a story of its own and if it takes time trying to break the Batman TAS, then it should've been in its own world. Dear Mr. Liu, please do not use Batman TAS for anything if you're going to give us something new. Just give us something new. This story could've been its own thing and it could've been great. \n\nIssue #2: Show don't tell. \n\nPretty much a copy of the graphic novel panel by panel. Come on spice it up a bit give us different angles, close-ups and MOVEMENT. Show us what animation can do even if it's on a tight budget. Show us the wonder and essence of the world. Make us feel the DESIRE Batgirl has to work with Batman, let us hear the thunder and rain crashing down on everything show us the details that move us emotionally. When we see the Joker from afar talking to the police about his wife, give us those strong visuals that tell the story on their own instead of him flatly saying his wife is dead. Show his loss and his madness. Don't deliver lines at dramatic points. Don't make Batman aware and comment on his meta-role as a foil to the Joker ‚Äì that's obvious and doesn't need to be in focus (even if in the original).\n\nIssue #3: Same story no insights. \n\nThe Killing Joke is a very dark story and sometimes less is more. The Joker on his tirade fails to truly shock the audience. What he chose to do should've been the true horror of the story and presented as such so it sneaks up slowly on the audience. This could've been accomplished in so many creative ways. It was literally just given to the audience and rather quickly. \n\nIn closing, it makes me think twice when an older 1993 movie like Batman: Mask of the Phantasm (highly underrated btw) outdoes The Killing Joke as a serious film with some substance to pack and scenes that tell a story on their own. I can't believe I'm saying this but the Joker was downright chilling in Phantasm and I watched that movie as an adult. It's not the inner fanboy leaking but a respect for the art. Watch Phantasm or Batman TAS if you're looking for a mature story that knows what it's doing. They may not have the newest animation or fan-service but it does have characters you'll care about and a story that will touch your soul.",

I also didn't care that it got an R-rating in the US; I cannot think of a film that was 'good' simply because it was graphic, and those excited that a franchise got such a rating are really missing the point. Anyway, watching the film was a serious disappointment. The first half was dull and lacking anything that really linked to the second half in a satisfying manner. I really do not care whether or not it is in the source material, for me it was more that it was dull and disconnected. The second half I the film proper and to be fair it is better, but not as good as it needed to be.\n\nThere is a real lack of grit and atmosphere in the delivery. For all the time spent with Batgirl, the film could have fleshed out dialogue, horrors, and conflict between the characters. Instead this felt truncated and lacking roots. For all the potential in the led two, there was little delivered but yet just enough to indicate what it could have been. It felt rushed, which may have been true because the film as a whole has a cheap feeling. The animation has little character or depth, and looked basic in both detail but also in movement. Searching online as to why, it seems that the animation was every 4 frames, which contributes to a choppy feel despite reducing cost. The voice work is good throughout, just a shame not to have a better product to deliver.\n\nThe Killing Joke had a lot of hype, most of which I ignored. Even with no preconceptions and reasonable expectations though, the film didn't deliver, and feels cheap, rushed, and poorly filled out.",

        "reviewText": "'BATMAN: THE KILLING JOKE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)\n\nAnother animated superhero flick, in the DC Universe Animated Original Movies series (and the first one ever to be Rated R). This one is adapted from the 1988 graphic novel (of the same name), by Brian Bolland and Alan Moore. It tells the story of an escaped Joker, who attacks and tortures the Gordon family; in order to prove a twisted point about his troubled past. It was directed by Sam Liu (a veteran DC animated movie, and TV series, director) and it was written by Brian Azzarello (who also wrote a segment of the 1998 DC animated feature 'BATMAN: GOTHAM KNIGHT'). The film stars the voice talents of Kevin Conroy, as Batman, and Mark Hamill, as the Joker (both reprising their roles from 'BATMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES'). It also costars Tara Strong, Ray Wise and Maury Sterling. The movie received mixed reviews from critics, and fans alike; and it performed modestly well at the Box Office (during a very brief theatrical run). I really enjoyed it. \n\nThe film begins with a 30-minute prologue (that was not in the graphic novel) detailing Batman (Conroy) and Batgirl's (Strong) troubled relationship, as they pursue a criminal named Paris Franz (Maury Sterling). The movie then gets to the heart of it's story, when the Joker (Hamill) escapes from Arkham Asylum. The superviallain then attacks Commissioner Gordon (Wise), and his daughter Barbara (aka Batgirl), at their home. He begins a diabolical plan, to prove that everyone can be driven just as mad as him. The whole time we see flashbacks of the Joker's origins (detailing how he became an insane master criminal). \n\nThe movie has been negatively criticized for it's added prologue scenes; which also include a (heavily criticized) sex scene, between Batman and Batgirl. None of that bothered me though (I actually liked it); but I'm not a regular comic book reader (and I've never read more than a few Batman comics). I am a fan of the Batman movies though (especially the last four, and Tim Burton's original two), and the animated series (which I did watch regularly as a kid). I really enjoyed this new feature; I like the action, the look of it all, and the story. I also love Hamill and Conroy, in the lead roles, and I really like all of their character development (as well as Batgirl's). I also like that they chose to go the R rated route; it's an exceptionally well made film!\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/MPT8bbqblmM",

Initially defiant, Batgirl subsequently reacts by having sudden impulsive sex with Batman, then by quitting as Batgirl.

But Gordon does not break, and directs Batman to bring The Joker in by the book.\n\nThe Alan Moore /Brian Bolland comic on which the latter section of this animated feature is based is a powerful piece of work. Not entirely successful, it is nonethless extremely well written, cleverly scripted, and brilliantly drawn. Some of that shows up in the dialogue, and much of the visuals are clearly based on the comic, but both fall short of the work they come from.\n\nNow to the opening section, the key point of which is the abrupt rooftop sexual encounter. From a dramaric point of view, I can see that this was intended to raise the emotional stakes of Barbara's shooting, yet the encounter is left in isolation snd nothing is made of it. This constitures poor writing. The only justification for an unnecessary, out of place sexual act is thrown away, making the act pointless from a storytelling point of view, leaving it seem like unsavoury wish-fulfilment on the part of the filmmakers.\n\nThis should have been much better than it was.",

The first one, \"Bat-Crybaby,\" literally put me to sleep.

What kind of message is that supposed to send to people? That it's ok to rape a sweet girl and turn her into a paraplegic and just go out for a beer after?! BATMAN of all people?! This writer obviously has the most nonsensical notion of Batman's moral compass that I can imagine. Barbara Gordon is a paraplegic rape victim in traction with tubes in her in the hospital and in the meantime Gotham's \"Knight\" is chuckling at Joker's jokes for an end scene? What kind of superhero movie is this? It is kinda funny though, maybe that's the why of the title?",

There was a couple of things that bothered me. I think the important part was too short (about 45 minutes), they gave too much emphasis to the Batgirl prologue, I mean, the Joker appeared 30 minutes after the movie initiated, for God sake! Yes, there was some things from that part that I thought were interesting, I'm sure some people will hate them though. I was very uncomfortable with the inconsistency of the art style, sometimes The Joker looked amazing, sometimes... not very good; besides, the animation was very weak in several scenes, I mean like 10 fps and that's unacceptable Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy's work was the best of the movie, I can't complain about that. It was OK. But they could do it a lot better.",

        "reviewText": "Much of the controversy around this movie surrounds the first half, so I am going to concentrate on that portion. People in the theatre I went to said they would have loved The Killing Joke, if not for the first half. I argue that the second half would not make any sense without the first. As perhaps one of the most famous hero and villain duos in all of fiction, it is easy to see Batman and the Joker as diametrically opposed in their approach to crime. I believe the first portion of the film serves to demonstrate some of these differences, especially Batman's tendency to control everyone/everything around him (as opposed to Joker's outright nihilism), and stands them on their heads. We start to see Batman as imperfect, and perhaps not so different from any Gotham resident.\n\nThis imperfection serves to develop some of the sympathy we feel towards the Joker and his ultimate goal regarding his confrontation with Batman, regardless of his twisted techniques. Evidence of this comes with some of the Joker's quips, which come with a visceral laugh despite their macabre nature.\n\nThe only area for potential complaint comes with the animation in certain scenes, though I'm not sure this was unintentional due to rushing for completion or due to intentionally demonstrating something quite \"off\" about the whole situation at hand.\n\n4 out of 4 stars.",

      "text": "This animated film starts with Barbara Gordon/Batgirl (voice of Tara Strong) observing Bruce Wayne/Batman (voice of Kevin Conroy) meeting with Commissioner Jim Gordon (voice of Ray Wise). Gordon shone the bat-signal to call Batman due to a robbery in progress. Batman heads off to take care of it while Batgirl pursues the robbers herself.\n\nThe getaway van is driven by two punks, one among them being Paris Franz (voice of Maury Sterling), nephew of Gotham City's biggest crime lord Carlos Francesco (voice of John DiMaggio). Batman chases the crooks in the Batmobile while Batgirl leaps onto the van. She blows the backdoor open, letting some other criminals shoots at Batman. Paris shoots at Batgirl, causing her to fall off the van. She and Batman end up catching one criminal, but Batman is upset with Batgirl for getting in the way and almost harming herself.\n\nParis and his buddy meet with Francesco. He is pissed at his nephew for Batgirl's intervention, where four of Francesco's men were caught, as well as $100,000. Francesco orders Paris to get the money back, or he'll have him killed.\n\nParis and his goons go to rob a warehouse. Batgirl finds them, which Paris was counting on since he's developed an infatuation with her. He sprays her with knockout gas, but she has enough time to knee him in the groin before hiding out in the vault. Paris and the others get away. After she comes to and the police arrive, Batman meets Batgirl on a rooftop. He expresses his concern for her work on the case and orders her to stay off it. This angers Barbara, making her feel like Batman won't trust her.\n\nThe criminals are on their boat after a night with some prostitutes. Paris gets a call from Francesco, and when his buddy picks up the phone, he gets shot in the head. Outside the boat are four shooters on a motorboat. Paris and his other cohort make their getaway by rigging the boat to explode as the hitmen board it, killing them all.\n\nParis sends a video message to Batgirl so she can go looking for him. Batman is with her while she watches it. He knows it's a trap, so he tells her to stay off the case. She doesn't listen and follows the clues, leading her to find another phone with a message from Paris. She is led to an apartment where she discovers Francesco's dead body. Two of Francesco's men show up, forcing Batgirl to flee. Batman arrives and starts kicking ass.\n\nBatman and Batgirl stand on a rooftop arguing. She is finally pushed over the edge and she begins to attack Batman. He defends himself but is quickly subdued. In the heat of the moment, Batgirl kisses him. She then takes off her cowl and suit, and they start to have sex. This later fills Barbara with regret.\n\nThe next night, Batgirl calls Batman as he is driving to find Paris. The Batmobile gets hit with an RPG by the docks. Batman ejects himself to safety and is faced by a bunch of crooks. Batgirl shows up on her motorcycle. She finds Paris and beats his face to a bloody pulp, but stops before she kills him.\n\nParis is arrested, but Batgirl realizes what Batman was saying in regards to his concern for her. She meets him as Barbara and tells her she is giving up being Batgirl.\n\nA while later, Batman meets with Detective Harvey Bullock (voice of Robin Atkin Downes) at a crime scene where four men have been found dead, all of them with big smiles on their faces. Batman knows this is the work of The Joker (voice of Mark Hamill). He and Bullock go to Arkham Asylum to meet with him in his cell. The Joker appears to be obscured in darkness. Batman tells him that this will end with one of them killing the other. The man doesn't respond and continues stacking playing cards. Batman grabs his hand and sees the man has white powder on his hand. He pulls the man into the light and sees he is not Joker, but a decoy.\n\nThe real Joker is meeting with another man to buy out an abandoned amusement park for a sinister purpose.\n\nWe see a flashback of Joker before he became what he is now. He was a struggling comedian tending to his pregnant wife Jeannie (voice of Anna Vocino). The two had been in financial troubles for a while, and he was trying to find a way to support his growing family.\n\nBruce is in the batcave trying to figure out what Joker's motives are. Alfred (Brian George) tells him he can't save everyone.\n\nBarbara is with her father in his apartment. She hears a knock at the door, thinking it's a friend of hers. It's The Joker, holding a gun. He shoots Barbara in her abdomen and sends her crashing onto a coffee table in front of Gordon. Two of Joker's men come in and beat Gordon before taking him away.\n\nAnother flashback shows Pre-Joker meeting with two gangsters at a bar as he tries to come up with some money. The gangsters want him to help them break into the chemical plant where he once worked so that they can pull off a heist at the card company next to it. They show Pre-Joker the mask they want him to wear, which is that of The Red Hood. Two officers find Pre-Joker at the bar and inform him that Jeannie has died in an accident. The man expresses grief and says he has no more reason to go through with the crime. The gangsters give him their condolences but insist that it's too late for him to back out now.\n\nBatman finds Barbara at the hospital. The doctor tells him that she will never be able to walk again due to the through-and-through bullet injury to her spine. Bullock also implies to Batman that Joker may have raped her. Barbara wakes up and tells Batman that Joker is trying to prove a point, and that Gordon is \"top of the bill\".\n\nGordon is taken to Joker's amusement park where he is tortured by some of Joker's freak show henchmen. The freaks take Gordon onto a ride through a house of horrors as Joker puts on a performance with the other freaks. Gordon is forced to see pictures of Barbara nude and bloodied, with Joker's intention being to drive Gordon insane.\n\nThe last flashback shows Pre-Joker and the gangsters getting ready to pull off the heist as Pre-Joker wears Red Hood's mask and cape. They engage in a shootout with security as Batman arrives on the scene. The gangsters die while Pre-Joker is startled by Batman. He trips over his cape and falls into a vat of chemicals. He is swept out through a pipe into the river. Once he gets out, he sees his reflection in a puddle. His skin is bleached white, his lips are red, and his hair is green. His mind then warps into insanity, and he is now The Joker.\n\nBatman finds a clue that leads him to the amusement park. He finds Gordon, who remains sane. As Batman heads to pursue Joker, Gordon tells him to capture him \"by the books\" to show that their way works. Batman follows Joker into the funhouse as he fends off the freaks who try to kill Batman. Joker taunts Batman by saying the world isn't worth fighting for and how one bad day can turn anyone insane, as it was one bad day that led Batman into becoming what he is now. The two of them fight until Batman throws himself and Joker out the window. Joker tries to shoot him, but the gun only pops out a \"click bang bang\" sign. Batman tells Joker that he doesn't want either of them to kill each other, and he offers to help him be better. Joker declines, saying it's too late for him. He then starts to tell a joke about two men escaping from a loony bin. After the punchline, both Batman and Joker start laughing together.\n\nDuring the end credits, Barbara is seen in a wheelchair. She goes into her room and onto the computer, where we see the Oracle logo, indicating that she has new work to begin."

Can Batman & Robin save the day?\n\nRemember when Batman was fun? Not a serious scene in sight, no tales of revenge or personal demons to burst from the screen in a day glow burst of thunder. For many of us who grew up in the 60s and 70s this was the only Batman that mattered, pure unadulterated fun, all campy veneer and skin tight Technicolor suits. This full length outing for the dynamic duo is of course just an extended episode from the joyous TV series, just add a bit more money and you got a Bat Boat, a Bat Helicopter and erm, erm, Bat Shark Repellent! It's just wonderful I tell you.\n\nHow any of the actors kept straight faces is anyones guess, but they did, and they collectively delighted millions of children and like minded adults in a way that can't be described to the none believers, thank holy god for the caped crusaders that always kept us safe. 8/10\n\nFootnote: Watching now in my middle years I ask any red blooded male this; is there anything more sexy than Lee Meriwether in the Catwoman suit?

        "reviewText": "Having, losing, gaining... to a generation of kids this WAS Batman. Only when Tim Burton reinvented the big screen perception of the \"caped crusader\" did it become outdated. \n\nThe third of the new films, Batman Forever parodied this film and the series with a \"holy\" joke. Unfortunately the movie in question was the first to be directed by Joel Schumacher, and so was consequently brash and bereft of wit. Yes, thanks to ShoeMaker this version of Gotham has suddenly become the coolest yet again. \n\nIt's all such brilliant fun, awash with the irony so gloriously absent from Batman & Robin. Michael Keaton was a wonderfully dark Batman, but the other two were planks. Adam West is knowingly hammy as the title role, and relishes the deliberately cheesy lines. He has a potbelly and a costume that looks like it was made out of an old binliner. Anyone who cannot see the genius of that is beyond help. Burt Ward's brilliantly overacted Robin is also hilarious, and far less irritating than the asinine Chris O'Donnell version. \n\nThe Batmobile is ace, too. I remember having a chunky Corgi model of the car that shot out matchsticks across the room. Much better than a CGI-enhanced penile extension. Even the rubbish filmed backdrops are fun. Everything's a bat-something in this film, a rope ladder having a large \"Bat Ladder\" sign tied to the end. \n\nThis is a fantastic movie, how could anyone not love it? Some hilarious scenes include the shark fight, the trap door spring and Batman with the biggest (and longest-fused) bomb in history. Look at this dialogue exchange where they try to work out which supervillain is behind the mayhem: \"But wait! It happened at sea. See? C for Catwoman.\" \"An exploding shark ... was pulling my leg.\" \"The Joker! It all led to a sinister riddle. Riddle -er. Riddler?\" \n\nFortunately, it turns out they're all involved, along with Burgess Meredith as the Penguin. The scenes set on the villains' hideout are shot with the camera at slanted angles, an inspired touch. All the poor things about this film work in its favour - Cesar Romero as the Joker looks about 80 and clearly hasn't bothered to shave off his moustache, but it works, as does the full-bore \"acting\" of Meredith and Merriwether. Only Frank Gorshin as the Riddler slightly disappoints; though that's because he's nowhere near as over the top. He is, of course, infinitely preferable to Jim Carrey. Anyway, they all work superbly together and the film doesn't feel top-heavy. A huge flaw of the new series, where more than one villain never quite clicked, can you imagine Nicholson, Pfeiffer, Carrey and DeVito all in the same movie? Of course it'd be impossible not just in budget but in egos, so having modest TV actors here serves the story well. One strange element of characterisation is seeing the Joker getting bossed around by the Penguin, something that would never happen in the comics. \n\nSome of it's so wilfully silly it almost goes too far. If you put your tongue into your cheek you may choke, and seeing a Pentagon head playing tiddlywinks eggs the joke a little, though the whole thing is so well-meaning that you simply can't hold it against the movie. The plot, though, really isn't up to much at all, something I never noticed as a child (but then I never realised it was a comedy when I was a child, either). A repetitious sequence of events that sees the villains constantly trying to destroy Batman and Robin from afar, the heroes trying to locate their secret base. It goes round in circles, but a glorious \"Biff! Pow!\" fight on a submarine and a sideways swipe at eugenics make sure it all ends in style.\n\n Lastly, look out for the scene where Ward and West run up and down on the spot (\"Luckily we're in tip-top condition!\") while a film background of a street and the theme tune play - a classic. Simple, silly fun and almost relentlessly appealing. So much so I nearly added another point to the total... 6/10.",

This film is equally camp, but like the series it is also colourful and very enjoyable with great characters to drive it.\n\nThe pace does slacken a tad towards the end though it is quite fast and brisk up to then and the plot is quite thin and rather silly. However what does compensate a lot are some nice photography, colourful costumes, good scenery and a well-realised Gotham City. Also the music is great fun to listen to, the score is very driven especially. The dialogue is very cheesy, but that's part of the fun for me, and the gags are the sort of gleefully enjoyable throwaway ones that Schumacher's Batman and Robin could have dreamed of(I can't think of shark repellent without laughing uncontrollably now, and the \"some days you can't just get rid of a bomb\" line is one of the truest yet funniest lines I have heard in a film in recent memory). The direction is good and the effects and action are decent enough too.\n\nThe performances are very enjoyable and the characters are still fun. Adam West is a lot of fun, and does deserve some credit for making some of the cheesiest dialogue at least credible with a sly and deadpan delivery. Burt Ward is good enough, he is better in the series though, with some annoying/funny catchphrases and an easy-going chemistry with West. Alan Napier is a perfect Alfred, and Neil Hamilton is a hoot. The villains are what make the movie. Lee Merriweather is a very slinky Catwoman and that suit really suits her, and she is further advantaged by some fun lines and good delivery of them, also a fun and affecting chemistry with West. Frank Gorshin, Cesar Romero and especially Burgess Meredith show their successors how to play Riddler, Joker and Penguin, and all of them are great fun and this is one of a couple of times when the use of more than one villain works.\n\nRomero is the least exceptional of the four for me, he is still great but Joker is written and used better in the series meaning he was rather underused compared to the likes of Penguin and I also think he suffers from constant comparisons with Nicholson, Ledger and Hamill(if he counts). Perhaps unfair yet understandable, whereas Gorshin and Meredith are definitive in my opinion when it comes to Romero while I love him he is my least favourite Joker of the four(counting Hamill).\n\nIn conclusion, a lot of fun and perfect to go with the classic TV series, not as good but worthy. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

        "reviewText": "1966 was, among many other things, the year of \"Batman\". This campy color TV series (very) loosely based on the classic comic strip, was originally planned for a fall debut. But the ABC network which commissioned the show, had already seen several of their new programs fail dismally in the ratings. Desperate for some promising new material. they gave \"Batman\" the green light, and it premiered in January. Thanks to it's 'hip' humor, an eye-popping kaleidoscope of bizarre color backgrounds and a cast of \"guest villains\" second to none: Julie Newmar, Cesar Romero, Anne Baxter, Burgess Meredith (the list goes on and on) the show was an immediate smash. Suddenly, America became \"batty\" and it's popularity was so great that stars scrambled for a chance to appear on the program. Along with its ratings, success came the brilliant merchandising campaign - everything from bubble gum cards and records to underwear and cereal. Inevitably, a movie was planned, supposedly either to introduce audiences to the show (which wasn't necessary after all, because the program was picked up first) or to sell the series overseas. It's main function, of course, was to cash in on the Batmania flooding the country while it was still hot. So, with a slightly bigger budget - mainly to accommodate the construction of the batboat and the batcopter, a feature version of the show was quickly filmed between the end of the first season and the beginning of the second. By the time of the movie's release in August 1966, however, the Batman craze had already begun to fade. The critics, for the most part, dismissed the film and audiences chose to ignore it. And, in recent years, there has been some speculation as to what happened. Although it has been written that Twentieth Century-Fox did little to inform the public that this was a project made exclusively for the big screen and not (as with \"The Man from Uncle\") a compilation of previously seen television episodes edited into a feature. In fact, the movie was promoted both in advertising materials (trailers, posters, etc) and magazine features as being \"All New, Made Especially for the Giant Motion Picture Screen\". It appears that the viewing public felt that it was probably just more of the same, figuring there was no point in paying to see what they got for free at home. So, despite mass bookings in every theater available, the film came and went. But, seen today, \"Batman\" holds up well, capturing perfectly what was one of the biggest fads to come along in the sixties. \n\nAdam West and Burt Ward personify the clueless but virtuous Superheroes - always ready for a challenge, and, as usual, lionized by their puny police force led by Commissioner Gordon (Neil Hamilton) and Chief O'Hara (Stafford Repp). Alfred, alter-ego Bruce Wayne's faithful butler (Alan Napier) and Harriet Cooper (Madge Blake), aunt of Robin's alter ego Dick Grayson are on hand as well. The chief delight here though, are the four Supervillains - The Catwoman (Lee Meriwether, subbing for Julie Newmar), The Penguin (a rakish Burgess Meredith), The Joker (onetime Latin lover Cesar Romero) and The Riddler (a manic Frank Gorshin). The plot, the usual nonsense involving this crew's attempt at world domination, serves as a suitable background for sight gags and pratfalls galore. Meriwether and Meredith are the Villains with the most footage, each getting to disguise themselves during the course of the story. Posing as Russian reporter Miss Kitka, and sporting a commendably convincing accent, the incredibly lovely Meriwether is (understandably) successful in a scheme to lure Bruce Wayne into a kidnapping, hoping Batman will dash to the rescue! Meredith is not quite as able, in his guise as the villain's hostage Commodore Schmidlapp, though he does manage to get into the secret Batcave. And the plot thickens...West and Ward perform their chores with appropriately deadpan dispatch, but, as usual, the devils have the best parts, with Lee Meriwether offering a deliciously different interpretation of The Catwoman, and Burgess Meredith, who was born to play The Penguin, standing out. Batman is great fun both for younger viewers (who won't pick up on the intentional parody) and older ones (who will). \"Holy time capsule!\" Sevaral years ago, a wide screen DVD was released. It boasts an excellent transfer, Stereo sound and many extras, including a running commentary track with West and Ward, trailers, still galleries, and new featurettes about the film, and the Batmobile, with creator George Barris. A MUST for Batfans!",

Sorry, just had to get that out, I mean this movie leaves you will a cheesy goodness that is Batman.\n\nI know a lot of people always criticize and make fun of the series, but I don't understand how anyone could hate this? Yeah, it's a complete turn around from the original comic books, but it's just non stop laughter and even the actors were aware of that. You just have to love the sprays that Batman has, \"Shark repellent\"? LOL! Not to mention the fun villains who are just so \"filthy and diabolical\".\n\nI am in love with this script, I mean, it's so cheesy, but it did it on purpose. Like when Batman finds out the true identity of Catwoman and Robin says \"Holy Heartbreak!\". Or my favorite scene that is possibly my favorite scene of all time, where Batman has a bomb in his hands and is trying to get it out of people's way so they won't get killed, but no matter what he keeps bumping into the same marching band in the streets or finding people in the way, and finally he just sighs and says \"Some days you just can't get rid of a bomb\". CLASSIC! Please, watch this movie, it's beyond hilarious, just pay the $5.99 for the movie!\n\n9/10",

        "reviewText": "Try not to put it too much, at all, in line with the other Batman movies, first of all. The difference between Christopher Nolan's Batman films and the 1960's TV show and subsequent spin-off movie is the difference between a hat and a boot- they both fit, but never in the same sections (unless one likes walking on a hat or wearing a boot). Weird comparison? Try some of the one-liners in this movie, man! This is filled with so much comedy, both intentional and not so, one has to keep a tally on when things are meant to be crazy and when they just are by design of whatever's going on in the low-budget but high concept stratosphere. This is NOT your darker, Frank Miller/Grant Morrison/Alan Moore Batman work, but rather the by-product of a period where superheroes were just frigging goofy. And, hey, why not camp it up for all it's worth? \n\nMy high rating for this movie is and isn't ironic. It's got some of the cheesiest, lamest, most \"what-in-Jebuz-were-they-thinking\" sets and props (the shark is something Ed Wood would've cut out), dialog exchanges and super-obvious stereotypes (not the least of which on commies but also the UN room!), and it looks like half of its 30-day shooting schedule was used to play ping-pong when things got boring on the set. It is at its core for Bob Kane's creation what the 1978 Holiday Special was the George Lucas's Star Wars: it's so bad it's truly and utterly awesome for every moment it can squeeze out a frame. Watch it with friends, make wisecracks right alongside the characters, make your own Joker makeup and put it over your mustache, and try and put out of your mind \"HOLY ALMOST!\"\n\nBUT, at the same time, some of the writing by Lorenzo Semple Jr is, genuinely, clever and well-worded. Amid the stupidity and pandering and things that only kids would think are somewhat OK in the comic-book setting (and even I when I saw this as a kid knew it was WAY outside of the usual Batman ground), one marvels at some of the puns and gags and things that work, tremendously. And to be certain the bomb gag, with Batman running around trying to bypass nuns and ducks and babies is something that is about as close to Monty Python as one could ever hope for the dark knight, and it's pure genius. The film also boasts its all-star cast (save for Catwoman who was replaced momentarily), whom all chew up scenery like it's fillet mignon at the Old Homestead. The camera-person, too, is often in on the weird excitement, and has the kinds of tilted angles and perspectives one would normally see in a Terry Gilliam freak-out. Did I mention the weirdly awkward ending that seems resolved but has the air of uncertainty for no reason? \n\nBatman is a delightful bad-movie masterpiece, a not-totally guilty pleasure that you can't turn away from for a moment but realize is everything you wouldn't want Batman to be if taken at all seriously. For its time and place it came, it saw, and it conquered a good portion of the audience for three seasons and a cheap flick. And I love every second of it.",

It does, after all, treat the whole Batman concept with jokey disrespect (though really, as another reviewer pointed out, it's an over-the-top parody of the old serials). However, for those of us who see the inherent silliness in the notion of a \"millionaire playboy\" dressing up in a bat suit to fight \"supervillains,\" it's fun to watch a movie that sees it as well.\n\nPerhaps the most amusing aspect of this movie is its off-the-wall view of the United Nations; the particular ambassadors are treated as something more than bureaucrats, apparatchiks, and political cronies who could be replaced in five minutes with any of ten thousand equally capable (or incapable) people.\n\n7/10.",

It was always intended as comedy, and the special effcts, acting, etc., were designed to that effect. Maybe it's okay in comic books but can anyone take seriously a bunch of crazy hero/villains running around in capes and tights? You have to look back to those 13 chapter sci-fi serials of the 1940's to get the show/movie: each chapter ended with the heroes getting blown up, then the next chapter showed the last 5 minuts of the previous chapter except with the added footage showing the hero's escape. Then another 5 minutes of the characters recapping the entire story for the benefit of the audience if they hadn't seen the previous chapters. Quite amusing to watch today (I would recommend \"Lost City of the Jungle\" which loosely inspired Indiana Jones, and has those credits that stream up the screen like in Star Wars). That's why the Batman series were always 2-parters with ridiculous cliff hanger endings, with Batman uttering \"If I can only reach my utility belt...\" Adam West's performance can only be characterised as sublimely surreal: he really deserves an award. The only thing that comes close to this is Mystery Men, which many also unfortunately don't seem to get.",

Not to mention getting Dick Grayson a mother figure. Of course that would compromise their alternate identities, but is there no end to the dastardly plots that this crew can think up?\n\nBatman also marked the farewell performance of Reginald Denny as a silly English millionaire who the villains take over a submarine he owns and use it for their own evil plans.

The grim and gritty dark avenger is relatively recent, starting in the 70s (notwithstanding that this was the original conception of Batman - Robin, deliberately introduced to lighten the tone, made his first appearance in only the 12th Batman story published).\n\nThe Batman TV series of the mid-60s, to which this movie is an excellent feature-length companion piece, was contemporaneous with comics which were relatively light-hearted and cheerful. Robin quipped, the villains were larger than life, dastardly, inclined towards devilish and highly improbable traps, and pretty much didn't kill anyone (even the Joker). The TV series (and film) mirrored the comics of the time and, happily, discovered that when you deliver dialogue in a TV series which works on the printed page, the only way it still works is when it is presented as straight-faced but tongue-in-cheek humour.\n\nThis film is full to the brim of comic book daftness delivered with extreme good humour by actors playing their parts to the brim. The effects are cheesily appropriate, the script is a hoot and, if you're in tune with it, you're going to have a great time.\n\nIt's worth catching the DVD yak-track where Adam West and Burt Ward obviously derive great pleasure from being in each others company again.",

        "reviewText": "The State of Comics in 1966 was in Flux. Marvel was Riding High as Stan Lee and Jack Kirby with the Help of Others in the Marvel Bullpen Redefined Comics Beginning in About 1962 with the Introduction of Spider-Man in \"Amazing Adult Fantasy\" #15. \n\nAfter that Marvel Took Off and Never Looked Back. However DC Didn't Get it and Never Really Competed with Marvel and was in Such a State of Decline that Most of Their Titles were Embarrassingly Dated.\n\nThe Batman TV Show was a Reflection of DC's Batman at the Time Still Maintaining a 1950's Template. Silly, Juvenile, and Far From Serious Super-Hero Stuff. But what Wasn't Working in the Batman Comics Translated to TV Wonderfully. Mostly Because of the Over the Top Corniness and Bright Saturated Colors. \n\nSimply Put, there Wasn't Anything Like it on the Tube and it Captured the Imagination of the Public and Became a Surprise Cash-Cow and Marketing Bonanza. It was Pop-Culture Gone Wild (not unlike Burton's Movie in 1989).\n\nThis is the Theatrical Version of the TV Show that was Released Between the First and Second Season and was Basically Just More of the Same. If You Want to Get a Glimpse of the TV Show Before Shelling Out Big Bucks for the Blu-ray Complete Series, Check This Out and You will Know What You Are In For.\n\nThe Movie Works as a Stand Alone and is Colorful, Campy, and Fun. You Get Four Villains in One Setting and the Tone and Timbre of the TV Show is Here for a Quick Peek at What it was All About.",

        "reviewText": "The television series had been on the air for a season before Twentieth Century Fox released director Leslie H. Martinson's feature-length \"Batman\" film with Adam West as the Caped Crusader and Burt Ward as Robin the Boy Wonder. Unfortunately, the television series is available only as a bootleg so contemporary audiences may not be familiar with its outlandish, over-the-top interpretation. This version of \"Batman\" parodied the straightforward but adolescent spirit of the comic book character. Martinson and scenarist Lorenzo Semple accomplish this with considerable wit and style. In some ways, this movie surpasses the first four Warner Brothers' films. Typically, Batman tangled with two adversaries in the Warner Brothers movies. Instead, \"Batman\" pits the costume-clad crime fighters against a quartet of repellent rogues: The Penguin, Catwoman, The Joker, and The Riddler. These dastardly devils kidnap millionaire Bruce Wayne at one point, but he manages to escape from their clutches. The villains had a secret weapon that Batman must liberate from their clutches. They have a gadget the enables them to reduce a human to a pile of powder. They have been able to reverse the process. Essentially, these felons attack the Gotham City equivalent of the United Nations. They dehydrate the politicians on the Security Council with their gadget and turn each of them into a colored powder. The major complication near the end of the action, after Batman and Robin, have recovered the separate vials of powder for each politician occurs when another character bumps into Batman and the vials are accidentally smashed. Our heroes must figure a way to separate the powders and rehydrate them. Meantime, the Batmobile, the Batcycle, the Batboat, and the Batcopter made their first appearances. Burgess Meredith, Frank Gorshin, and Cesar Romero have field day respectively as The Penguin, The Riddler, and the Joker. Adam West is perfect as Batman, and his line delivery of the dialogue teeters between dead seriousness and lightweight humor. In supporting roles, Alan Napier, Neil Hamilton, and Stafford Repp are equally good. The ending is hilarious, principally because Batman and Robin don't get all the powders properly restore to the proper vials. Composer Nelson Riddle furnishes a terrific orchestral score that underlines the drama and the hilarity with equal success. Mind you, most Batman fans, especially of the Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale franchise will probably cringe at the liberties taken with the characters. Nevertheless, from the shark attack to the rehydration episode, \"Batman\" is still a landmark entry in the overall franchise.",

        "reviewText": "When a yacht carrying \"Commodore Schmidlapp\" (Reginald Denny) mysteriously disappears along with his new dehydration invention, \"Batman\" (Adam West) and \"Robin\" (Burt Ward) seek to find out what has happened in order to recover them. During the course of their investigation it is discovered that there are four known super-criminals at large: \"the Joker\" (Cesar Romero), \"the Penguin\" (Burgess Meredith), \"the Riddler\" (Frank Gorshin) and \"the Catwoman\" (Lee Meriwether). Obviously, if it were any two of them together it would have implications for Gotham City. If it were three then it would imperil the United States. But having all four together could only mean that they are intent upon taking over the world! Hence the concern by the Dynamic Duo, \"Commissioner Gordon\" (Neil Hamilton) and \"Chief O'Hara\" (Stafford Repp). Having said that, this is a film that should prove entertaining for people of all ages. It has the action the kids will enjoy and some humor which adults might find amusing as well. The part where \"Bruce Wayne\" (Adam West) is thinking about \"Kitka\" (Lee Meriwether) with his eyes closed and then tells her that his thoughts are about to reach a climax is just one example. Fortunately, she manages to slow him down and then invites him to her apartment for a night of hot--cocoa. Even so, in all honesty the fake props, over-the-top acting and the absurdity of it all results in a very cheap feel. Along with that I thought that it dragged on a bit too long. In short, this is one of those rare films that is simply not to be taken seriously. It isn't necessarily bad provided you're able to make allowances. But it isn't good by any stretch of the imagination either. As such a rating of average is probably accurate.",

        "reviewText": "I've never seen episodes of the original Batman, but I've always felt the modern movies (starting in 1989) were too dark and scary. I realize I'm in the vast minority and that audiences have come to feel the darker the better as the movies continue. However, these started as comic books for children, and when the movies are too violent or disturbing for children to watch, it loses the message.\n\nI absolutely loved Batman: The Movie. It made me want to watch old episodes of the ensuing television show. Released weeks after the last episode of the first season, audiences could see all their favorites up on the big screen while they were waiting for their recurrence on the small screen. Adam West and Burt Ward, who miraculously keep straight faces during all their hilarious lines, are adorable as Batman and Robin. They're funny and fun, and although they know it's silly, they act like they're enjoying themselves every step of the way. Frank Gorshin keeps his high energy as The Riddler, Cesar Romero gives his signature laugh and bounces off the walls as The Joker, Lee Meriwether shows off her Miss America figure as Catwoman, and Burgess Meredith waddles and quacks as The Penguin. They all seem to have a blast, as if we're eavesdropping on a fun costume party the actors are having.\n\nWith little touches that remind us it's a comic book adaptation, this movie is delightful from start to finish. In the scenes set at the bad guys' lair, the camera is tilted to mirror the angle of comic book frames. During the final fist-fight, \"Boom!\" and \"Ka-pow!\" words pepper the screen as fake punches are thrown. It's very cute. But it won't be for everyone. You'll either love it or hate it. If you love The Dark Knight, you'll probably hate the original. But if you want to be able to watch Batman with your kids, give it a try.",

If you appreciate film, watch this one. Adam West is a comic genius.\n\nThe script (obviously comprised by men smarter than we are led to believe in a room filled with contraband smoke) is a thing of Picasso-esque beauty. I am not a superhero connoiseur, but I do know that this movie is as fantastically POW WAM BANG WHAMMO as any superhero movie ever made. Do not ask yourself why the UN is guarded by a singular guard, or how Polaris missiles spell out riddles at the point of explosion, only ask yourself one question: Has there ever been any other film created where the all important phrase \"Sometimes you just can't get rid of a bomb\" is uttered so convincingly?",

        "reviewText": "This is the Batman movie made shortly after the television series started in 1966. I actually kind of enjoyed the film. Granted Adam West and Burt Ward were pretty hammy, the special effects were pretty cheap (probably even for back then), and there was more cheese to be found than on a tour of a Kraft factory. However, it seemed to serve as a period piece, to some extent, of the late 1960's. Everything in the film was intentionally cartoonish (probably because they wanted to keep the feel of the Batman comics of the time), and it did have some fine actors as the villains (you know Ceser Romero, Lee Meriwether, Burgess Meredith and Frank Gorshin). \n\nHere's the plot. Batman and Robin figure out that the Joker, Catwoman, the Penguin, and the Riddler must be in on some kind of plot to take over the world after a yacht carrying an eccentric inventor and his invention go missing en route to Gotham. The villains decide that they'll lure Batman to their secret lair to kill him by kidnapping Bruce Wayne (if you don't know his secret identity, you're probably the only person in the world except for the citizens of Gotham). They lure Bruce in by having Catwoman disguise herself as a Russian reporter who woos him. You'll have to see the rest to figure out what is going on and the rest of the plot (I don't want to give it away, and it's pretty wacky). Oh, and the Penguin managed to buy a pre-nuclear submarine from the US Navy leaving only a P.O. Box number as his address. Apparently, the Navy is as haphazard as the rest of Gotham and admirals play tidily winks with their secretaries when they should be reviewing important documents.\n\nThe thing that always struck me about the Batman TV series and movie is that no matter what obscure form of death the villains had for Batman and Robin, they always had something on their utility belts that would save them. It's like they each had the entire contents of a woman's handbag on their waists plus a few other things that no one knows what the hell they are. Of course, they're always saved in the nick of time. The other question I've always had is how the hell didn't they figure out that Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson are Batman and Robin. It's like the frigging Superman/Clark Kent mystery. Just look at their faces and listen to them talk. Even with the masks on, it's not that hard. Sheesh the citizens of Gotham have to be the most gullible people in the world.",

        "reviewText": "A tough one to rate. It certainly has entertainment value, but it's frustrating that it could have been so much better. On the one hand, the concept of bringing villains and other Spidermen in from alternate universes is fantastic, and it was great to see some of these characters again. There is so much star power in the cast here, and the special effects are wonderful.\n\nOn the other hand, there is quite a bit of bloat as well. I'm all for character development and non-action scenes in action movies, but too often these moments were poorly written and bogged the film down. I have to say, I didn't care for how na√Øve Tom Holland's version of Spider-Man was either, and I could never buy in to the concept that he would try to \"fix\" the villains before sending them back to their own universes. This seemed asinine to me, and how that would stop them from dying where they came from was a mystery too. There are several other plot elements that are either weakly crafted (Dr. Strange getting trapped by some quick Spidey-math) or boring (Peter Parker and his friends and their college admission drama, good grief). Give me more of the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), less of Ned Leeds, the goofy sidekick.",

        "reviewText": "Spider-Man: No Way Home is a phenomenal conclusion to the trilogy and Holland's best outing as Spidey yet. Starts off fun, safe and familiar and then becomes extremely emotional, satisfying and full of great callbacks. A love letter to all things Spider-Man.\n\nTom Holland gives an incredible lead performance once again, reliably charming and likeable but with a lot more emotional heft this time around. Zendaya and Jacob Batalon both have perfect chemistry with Holland and are also incredible in their own ways.\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch reaffirms why he's such a good Doctor Strange with his excellent dry wit and gravitas. All the returning villains give strong performances but Willem Dafoe is definitely the standout performance with an unsettling and terrifying presence.\n\nJon Watts' direction is superb, the action sequences are thrillingly acrobatic once again but refreshingly impactful this time around. There's a few homages to the styles of the previous iterations and some gorgeous imagery.\n\nIt's also perfectly paced with none of its roughly 2hr 30 minute runtime feeling dull or overly long due to a strong momentum established early on. The CG is extremely impressive with only a few weak spots.\n\nThe music by Michael Giacchino is fantastic, a nice balance of themes from the previous iterations and use of Holland's iconic motifs which are slightly altered in ways that work as well as a few new additions that are beautifully epic.",
